0,"Question: An 85-year-old man presents with worsening Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms, particularly near the time of his next dose of medication. His physical examination reveals a ""pill-rolling"" resting tremor, increased muscle tone, and resistance to passive movement at the joints. Which of the following medications is most likely to be added to this patient's current regimen?

Options:
A. Benztropine: Benztropine is an anticholinergic drug that can help manage Parkinson's disease symptoms by blocking acetylcholine receptors in the brain. However, it is not likely to be added to this patient's current regimen as it is not known to increase the efficacy of levodopa/carbidopa, rasagiline, aspirin, and captopril.

B. Selegiline: Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that can help manage Parkinson's disease symptoms by increasing the levels of dopamine in the brain. While it is possible that selegiline could be added to this patient's current regimen, it is not the most likely option as it is not known to increase the efficacy of the other medications in the patient's current regimen.

C. Entacapone: Entacapone is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that can help manage Parkinson's disease symptoms by increasing the efficacy of levodopa/carbidopa. Given the patient's worsening symptoms near the time of his next dose of medication, it is most likely that entacapone will be added to his current regimen to improve the efficacy of his anti-PD medication.

D. Bromocriptine: Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that can help manage Parkinson's disease symptoms by increasing the levels of dopamine in the brain. However, it is not likely to be added to this patient's current regimen as it is not known to increase the efficacy of the other medications in the patient's current regimen.

Answer: C. Entacapone"
1,"Question: A 30-year-old G2P1 woman, currently at 38 weeks estimated gestational age, presents with contractions. She reports no prenatal care due to lack of health insurance. Upon delivery, the infant appears jaundiced and has marked hepatosplenomegaly. Serum hemoglobin is 11.6 g/dL and serum bilirubin is 8 mg/dL. The direct and indirect Coombs tests are both positive. The mother has never had a blood transfusion. Her previous child was born healthy with no complications. Which of the following is most consistent with this neonate's most likely condition?

Options:

A. The neonate developed IgM autoantibodies to its own red blood cells
B. The mother generated IgG antibodies against fetal red blood cells
C. The mother generated IgM antibodies against fetal red blood cells
D. Vitamin K deficiency has led to hemolytic anemia

Answer: B. The mother generated IgG antibodies against fetal red blood cells

Explanation:

The patient's positive indirect Coombs test and jaundiced appearance suggest that the neonate has developed hemolytic anemia due to immune-mediated destruction of red blood cells. The mother's generation of IgG antibodies against fetal red blood cells is the most likely explanation for this condition. IgG antibodies are the most common type of antibody to cause hemolytic anemia in newborns, and the mother's lack of prenatal care and lack of health insurance suggest that she did not receive adequate prenatal care to prevent this complication.

Option A is incorrect because IgM autoantibodies are less common than IgG antibodies in causing hemolytic anemia in newborns. Option C is also incorrect because the mother's generation of IgM antibodies against fetal red blood cells is unlikely to cause hemolytic anemia in this situation. Option D is also unlikely because vitamin K deficiency is not a common cause of hemolytic anemia in newborns."
2,"Question: A 31-year-old man presents to the emergency department with acute tearing chest pain that radiates to the back. Despite appropriate treatment, the patient sadly passes away. An autopsy reveals an increase in mucoid extracellular matrix and loss of smooth muscle cell nuclei in the media of large arteries. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be present in this patient?

Options:
A. Nasal septum perforation
B. Inferonasal lens dislocation
C. Pes cavus with hammer toes
D. Pectus carinatum

Answer: D. Pectus carinatum.

Explanation: Pectus carinatum is a congenital deformity of the sternum and rib cage that can lead to compression of the mediastinum and great vessels, causing symptoms such as chest pain and difficulty breathing. The presence of this deformity in the patient, along with the other findings mentioned in the question, suggests that the patient may have had a underlying genetic disorder that predisposed them to the development of pectus carinatum and the subsequent cardiovascular complications."
3,"Question: A 56-year-old man visits his physician for a follow-up examination. During the physical examination, hyperpigmented plaques are noticed on the posterior neck and in the axillae. His hemoglobin A1c concentration is 7.4% and his fasting serum glucose concentration is 174 mg/dL. Which of the following factors is most likely to contribute to the patient's laboratory findings?

Options:
A. Increased BMI during childhood
B. Increased serum testosterone level
C. History of smoking
D. High waist circumference

Answer: D. High waist circumference

Explanation:
The patient's hyperpigmented plaques on the posterior neck and in the axillae are a classic sign of insulin resistance, which is often associated with central obesity or a high waist circumference. The patient's high hemoglobin A1c concentration and fasting serum glucose concentration also support this diagnosis. While increased BMI during childhood and smoking history can also contribute to insulin resistance, high waist circumference is the strongest predisposing factor for the patient's laboratory findings in this case."
4,"Question: A 24-year-old man presents with recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea with fatty porridge-like stools and occasional blood up to 8 times per day, joint pain, and weight loss. Ileocolonoscopy shows regions of erythema, swelling, and cobblestone-like appearance of the ascending colon and terminal ileum. Targeted biopsies are taken for evaluation. One of the slides, which underwent histological assessment, is shown in the image. Which of the following best describes the histologic finding marked with the blue circle?

Options:

A. Crypt ulcer - This is a small, round, shallow lesion that occurs in the mucosa of the colon and is characterized by a loss of epithelial cells and a variable amount of inflammation.

B. Cryptitis - This is an inflammation of the crypts of the colon, which are the small, finger-like projections in the mucosa of the colon where the epithelial cells are produced. Cryptitis can cause erosion of the mucosa and lead to the formation of ulcers.

C. Granuloma - This is a small, rounded mass of immune cells that forms in response to inflammation or infection. Granulomas can occur in various parts of the body, including the colon.

D. Epithelial cell dysplasia - This is a condition where there is abnormal growth and development of epithelial cells in the colon. It can lead to the formation of polyps or cancer.

Answer: B. Cryptitis"
5,"Question: An 11-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department due to high-grade fever, headache, and nausea for 3 days. She avoids looking at any light source because it aggravates her headache. She has acute lymphoblastic leukemia and completed her last chemotherapy cycle 2 weeks ago. She appears lethargic, with a temperature of 40.1°C (104.2°F), pulse of 131/min, and blood pressure of 100/60 mm Hg. Examination reveals a stiff neck, equally reacting pupils, and decreased muscle strength in the right upper extremity. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and sensation is intact. Extraocular movements are normal. Two sets of blood cultures are obtained. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. CT scan of the head - Incorrect. A CT scan of the head may be considered if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, or if there are signs of intracranial complications such as bleeding or mass lesions. However, given the patient's recent chemotherapy and acute leukemia diagnosis, the most appropriate next step is to start antibiotic therapy to cover potential bacterial infections, as described in option C.

B. MRI of the brain - Incorrect. An MRI of the brain may be considered if there are signs of intracranial complications such as bleeding or mass lesions, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient.

C. Antibiotic therapy - Correct. Given the patient's recent chemotherapy and acute leukemia diagnosis, the most appropriate next step in management is to start antibiotic therapy to cover potential bacterial infections.

D. Lumbar puncture - Incorrect. A lumbar puncture may be considered if there are signs of meningitis or encephalitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient."
6,"Question: A 73-year-old man visits his primary care physician with complaints of increased urinary frequency, nocturia, and incomplete bladder emptying after voiding. He is otherwise healthy with no active medical conditions. During the examination, a large, symmetric, firm, smooth prostate is palpated. What potential complication could arise from the patient's current condition?

Options:
A. Hydronephrosis: Hydronephrosis is the enlargement of one or both kidneys due to obstruction of the flow of urine. In this case, the patient's symptoms of increased urinary frequency and nocturia could be indicative of hydronephrosis.
B. Bladder cancer: Bladder cancer is a malignancy that can cause symptoms similar to those presented by the patient, including hematuria (blood in the urine), painful urination, and persistent urinary tract infections. Although the patient is otherwise healthy, it is important to consider the possibility of bladder cancer in the differential diagnosis.
C. Prostatitis: Prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland, which can cause symptoms such as urinary frequency, nocturia, and painful urination. However, the patient's symptoms may be more consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI) than prostatitis.
D. Renal cancer: Renal cancer is a malignancy that can cause symptoms such as flank pain, hematuria, and weight loss. Although the patient is not experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to consider the possibility of renal cancer in the differential diagnosis.

Answer: A. Hydronephrosis."
7,"Sure! Here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 24-year-old man who is postoperative day 1 after an emergency appendectomy is evaluated by the team managing his care. He complains that he still has not been able to urinate after removal of the urinary catheter that was inserted during surgery. Given this issue, he is started on a medication that acts on a post-synaptic receptor and is resistant to a synaptic esterase. Which of the following is most likely another use of the medication that was administered in this case?

Options:
A. Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis - This condition is unrelated to the medication given to the patient, which is used to treat neurogenic ileus.
B. Glaucoma management - The medication does not have any known effects on glaucoma or its management.
C. Neurogenic ileus - This is the most likely outcome of the medication given to the patient, as it acts on post-synaptic receptors and is resistant to synaptic esterase.
D. Pupillary contraction - The medication does not have any direct effects on pupillary contraction.

Answer: C. Neurogenic ileus"
8,"Question: A 26-year-old gravida 3 para 1 is admitted to labor and delivery with uterine contractions. She is at 37 weeks gestation with no primary care provider or prenatal care. She gives birth to a boy after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery with APGAR scores of 7 at 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes. His weight is 2.2 kg (4.4 lb) and the length is 48 cm (1.6 ft). The infant has weak extremities and poor reflexes. The physical examination reveals microcephaly, palpebral fissures, thin lips, and a smooth philtrum. A systolic murmur is heard on auscultation. Identification of which of the following factors early in the pregnancy could prevent this condition?

Options:
A. Phenytoin usage - Incorrect. Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant medication that can be harmful to the developing fetus if taken during pregnancy, but it is not directly linked to the condition described in the passage.
B. Alcohol consumption - Correct! Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which can result in physical and cognitive abnormalities similar to those described in the passage.
C. Maternal toxoplasmosis - Incorrect. Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy. While it can cause developmental abnormalities, it is not directly linked to the condition described in the passage.
D. Maternal hypothyroidism - Incorrect. Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, during pregnancy can lead to cognitive and physical abnormalities in the fetus, but it is not directly linked to the condition described in the passage.

Answer: B. Alcohol consumption"
9,"Question: A newborn is brought to the pediatric clinic by his mother because she has noticed a swelling in the belly while dressing her baby. On physical examination, the newborn is found to have a non-tender upper abdominal mass. The clinician also noticed absent irises and undescended testes in this baby. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan of the abdomen shows a mass of intra-renal origin. Which 1 of the following genetic disorders is most probably the cause of this neonate's symptoms and signs?

Options:
A. WT-1 missense mutation
B. Deletion 11-p-13
C. Deletion 11-p-15
D. Duplication of 11-p-15

Answer: B. Deletion 11-p-13

Explanation: The combination of symptoms and signs in this neonate, including the non-tender upper abdominal mass, absent irises, and undescended testes, are highly consistent with the diagnosis of Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, also known as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). WPW syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a deletion of chromosome 11p13, which results in the absence of the adrenal gland's ability to produce cortisol and aldosterone hormones. The non-tender upper abdominal mass in this case is likely due to the accumulation of excess androgens produced by the remaining adrenal gland tissue. The absence of irises and undescended testes are also common findings in WPW syndrome. Therefore, option B, Deletion 11-p-13, is the most likely cause of this neonate's symptoms and signs."
10,"Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of left-sided neck swelling that has slowly progressed over the past 4 weeks. He has no history of serious illness. Temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows a non-tender, mobile mass in the left submandibular region with overlying erythema. A biopsy of the mass shows caseating granulomas. Pharmacotherapy with azithromycin and ethambutol is initiated. This patient is most likely to experience which of the following adverse effects related to ethambutol use?

Options:

A. Acute kidney injury
B. Color blindness
C. Methemoglobinemia
D. Peripheral neuropathy

Answer: B. Color blindness

Explanation: Ethambutol, a drug commonly used to treat tuberculosis, can cause color blindness (also known as optic neuritis) as an adverse effect. This is due to the drug's toxic effect on the optic nerve, leading to inflammation and damage to the nerve fibers responsible for color vision. While acute kidney injury, methemoglobinemia, and peripheral neuropathy are also potential adverse effects of ethambutol, they are less likely to occur in this patient population."
11,"Sure! Here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 75-year-old woman with a history of late-onset autoimmune diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis presents to the ship medic with altered mental status. While on her current cruise to the Caribbean islands, she experienced nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She takes aspirin, simvastatin, low-dose prednisone, glargine, and aspart. She is allergic to amoxicillin and shellfish. She works as a greeter at a warehouse and smokes 5 packs/day. Her temperature is 100.5°F (38.1°C), blood pressure is 90/55 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 30/min. Her pupils are equal and reactive to light bilaterally. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but her breath has a fruity odor. She has an early systolic murmur best appreciated at the left upper sternal border. She has reproducible peri-umbilical tenderness. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be present in this patient?

A. Respiratory acidosis and contraction metabolic alkalosis
B. Respiratory alkalosis and non-contraction metabolic alkalosis
C. Respiratory alkalosis and anion-gap metabolic acidosis
D. Respiratory acidosis and anion-gap metabolic acidosis

Answer: C. Respiratory alkalosis and anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

Rationale: The patient's altered mental status, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea suggest a metabolic acidosis, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as diabetes, kidney disease, or drug toxicity. The presence of an early systolic murmur and reproducible peri-umbilical tenderness also suggest cardiac dysfunction. However, the patient's respiratory symptoms and the presence of a fruity odor on breath suggest respiratory alkalosis. The anion-gap metabolic acidosis is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's history of autoimmune disorders and smoking."
12,"Question: A 62-year-old man presents with ""yellowing"" of the skin. He reports intermittent upper abdominal pain relieved by Tylenol and has lost some weight over the past several months. His past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus and a 40-pack-year smoking history. Physical examination reveals mild jaundice and a palpable gallbladder. Laboratory findings show elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels, and an ultrasound reveals a hypoechoic mass in the epigastric region. The patient is scheduled for a CT abdomen and pelvis with specific organ protocol for further evaluation. Which of the following best describes this patient's most likely diagnosis?

A. Caffeine consumption is an established risk factor for this condition.
B. The majority of cases occur in the body of the pancreas.
C. Patients with this condition often rapidly develop glucose intolerance and severe diabetes.
D. CA 19-9 is a marker for this condition.

Answer: D. CA 19-9 is a marker for this condition.

The patient's symptoms of yellowing of the skin, intermittent upper abdominal pain, and weight loss, along with his laboratory findings of elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels, are consistent with a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare and aggressive cancer that originates in the bile ducts within the liver. CA 19-9 is a tumor marker that is elevated in the majority of patients with cholangiocarcinoma, making it a useful diagnostic tool. While the other options are potential causes of the patient's symptoms, they are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings."
13,"Question: As a primary care physician specializing in elderly patient care, you are researching guidelines for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. You are particularly interested in aspirin recommendations, as several patients have asked you about its use. Which patient should be started on lifelong aspirin monotherapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention?

Options:

A. A 75-year-old male who had a drug-eluting coronary stent placed 3 days ago

B. A 67-year-old female with diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation

C. An 83-year-old female with a history of a hemorrhagic stroke 1 year ago without residual deficits

D. A 63-year-old male with a history of a transient ischemic attack

Answer: D. A 63-year-old male with a history of a transient ischemic attack.

Rationale: The patient with a history of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) is the most appropriate candidate for lifelong aspirin monotherapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention. TIAs are a warning sign for a future full-blown stroke, and aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent TIAs and fatal cardiovascular events in this population. The other options do not meet the criteria for lifelong aspirin therapy, as they have other comorbidities that may affect the efficacy or safety of aspirin use."
14,"Question: An 18-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a pruritic rash on his penis that developed after unprotected sexual intercourse with his girlfriend. The rash is accompanied by a history of recent exposure to a friend who had a similar rash on her body, and the patient also has a history of a previous itchy rash after blowing up balloons. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Intravenous acyclovir
B. Oral cromolyn sodium
C. Oral famotidine
D. Oral cetirizine

Answer: D. Oral cetirizine

Rationale: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, which can cause a pruritic rash on the genitalia. Cetirizine is an antihistamine that can help manage the itching associated with HSV infection. While acyclovir is an antiviral medication that can be effective in treating HSV infection, it may not be necessary in this case as the patient does not have any symptoms of viral shedding. Cromolyn sodium is not effective in treating HSV infection, and famotidine is not relevant to the patient's symptoms."
15,"Question: A 17-year-old girl presents with significant weight loss over the last few months. There is a positive family history of Hodgkin lymphoma and hyperthyroidism. Her blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg, pulse rate is 60/min, and respiratory rate is 17/min. Her weight is 41 kg and height is 165 cm. On physical examination, the patient is ill-appearing. Her skin is dry, and there are several patches of thin hair on her arm. No parotid gland enlargement is noted and her knuckles show no signs of trauma. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:

Hemoglobin: 10.1 g/dL
Hematocrit: 37.7%
Leukocyte count: 5,500/mm³
Neutrophils: 65%
Lymphocytes: 30%
Monocytes: 5%
Mean corpuscular volume: 65.2 µm³
Platelet count: 190,000/mm³
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 10 mm/h

Which of the following findings is associated with this patient’s most likely condition?

A. Amenorrhea

Explanation: The patient's significant weight loss, dry skin, and patches of thin hair on her arm are all symptoms of anorexia nervosa, a condition characterized by a distorted body image and an intense fear of gaining weight. The patient's family history of Hodgkin lymphoma and hyperthyroidism also support this diagnosis. Amenorrhea is a common symptom of anorexia nervosa, as the disorder can disrupt the menstrual cycle.

B. Dental caries: This option is not relevant to the patient's presentation.

C. Abdominal striae: This option is not relevant to the patient's presentation.

D. Parotid gland enlargement: This option is not relevant to the patient's presentation. The patient's physical examination did not reveal any signs of parotid gland enlargement."
16,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: An investigator is examining the effectiveness of a novel anti-gout drug compared to colchicine in an animal model. The test group receives the new drug, while the control group gets colchicine injections. Which cellular process will most likely be disrupted in the control subjects after the injection?

Options:
A. Hair cell function
B. Muscle contraction
C. Axonal transport
D. Cell-cell bonding

Answer: C. Axonal transport."
17,"Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician due to a 4-week history of generalized fatigue and malaise. He was born at term and has been healthy since. His mother has a history of recurrent anemia. He appears pale. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F) and pulse is 97/min. Examination shows pale conjunctivae and jaundice. The abdomen is soft and nontender; the spleen is palpated 3–4 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show:

Hemoglobin 9.3 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 81.3 μm3
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 39% Hb/cell
Leukocyte count 7300/mm3
Platelet count 200,000/mm3
Red cell distribution width 19% (N = 13–15)

Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?

A. Fluorescent spot test
B. Eosin-5-maleimide binding test
C. Indirect antiglobulin test
D. Peripheral smear

Answer: B. Eosin-5-maleimide binding test

Rationale: The patient's laboratory results suggest a possibility of hemolytic anemia, which is a condition where red blood cells are destroyed prematurely. The Eosin-5-maleimide binding test is a specific test for hemolytic anemia, which measures the amount of intact red blood cells in the circulation. This test is likely to confirm the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in this patient."
18,"Question: A new monoclonal antibody checkpoint inhibitor for advanced melanoma has shown promise in animal studies and early-phase human clinical trials, with high efficacy and low toxicity. To compare this drug to existing standard of care immunotherapy, the research team will offer the novel drug to patients at risk of toxicity with the current treatment. What level of evidence can this study provide?

Options:
A. Level 1 - No evidence
B. Level 2 - Limited evidence
C. Level 4 - Moderate evidence
D. Level 5 - Strong evidence

Answer: B. Level 2 - Limited evidence

Explanation: This study can provide limited evidence (Level 2) as it compares a new drug to an existing standard of care treatment, but the study population is limited to patients who are at risk of toxicity with the current treatment. While the study may show promise in this specific patient population, the results may not be generalizable to the broader patient population. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to provide stronger evidence for the effectiveness and safety of the novel drug."
19,"Question: A 12-year-old girl presents to the pediatric dermatologist with an expanding, but otherwise asymptomatic erythematous patch on her right shoulder, which she first noticed 3 days ago. The girl states the rash started as a small red bump but has gradually progressed to its current size. No similar lesions were observed elsewhere by her or her mother. She has felt ill and her mother has detected intermittent low-grade fevers. During the skin examination, a target-like erythematous patch, approximately 7 cm in diameter, was noted on the left shoulder (as shown in the image). Another notable finding was axillary lymphadenopathy. On further questioning it was revealed that the patient went camping with her grandfather approximately 11 days ago; however, she does not recall any insect bites or exposure to animals. The family has a pet cat living in their household. Based on the history and physical examination results, what is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Tinea corporis
B. Lyme disease
C. Granuloma anulare
D. Hansen’s disease

Answer: B. Lyme disease

The patient's symptoms of an expanding, asymptomatic erythematous patch on her shoulder, along with the finding of axillary lymphadenopathy, are highly suggestive of Lyme disease. The patient's recent exposure to the outdoors, particularly camping with her grandfather, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis). The target-like erythematous patch on the left shoulder is consistent with the characteristic erythema migrans rash of Lyme disease. While tinea corporis (Option A), granuloma anulare (Option C), and Hansen's disease (Option D) are all possible diagnoses, they are less likely given the patient's history and physical examination findings."
20,"Question: A 35-year-old man presents to the Veterans Affairs hospital with a 2-month history of anxiety. He recently returned from his third deployment to Iraq as a combat medic and has struggled to adjust to civilian life. He has been experiencing difficulty sleeping due to nightmares about the deaths of fellow soldiers and feels overwhelmed by guilt and responsibility for their deaths. During the mental status examination, his mood is depressed and his affect is restricted. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?

A. Motivational interviewing: This type of therapy focuses on identifying and resolving ambivalence about changing behavior, which may not be the most appropriate approach for this patient given his guilt and responsibility for the deaths of fellow soldiers.

B. Prazosin therapy: Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist that has been shown to be effective in treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, including nightmares and sleep disturbances. However, it may not address the patient's guilt and responsibility for the deaths of fellow soldiers.

C. Venlafaxine therapy: Venlafaxine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating depression and anxiety. However, it may not specifically target the patient's PTSD symptoms or address his guilt and responsibility for the deaths of fellow soldiers.

D. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is a type of talk therapy that helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their distress. Given the patient's guilt and responsibility for the deaths of fellow soldiers, CBT may be the most appropriate initial step in treatment to help him process and manage these feelings and develop coping strategies."
21,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 32-year-old Caucasian woman gives birth to male and female fraternal twins at term via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. At 2 days of age, the twin sister develops abdominal distension without emesis, and the mother reports that she has not noticed the passage of stool for this infant. Genetic testing reveals a deletion of an amino acid in a membrane channel for the girl. Given that both parents are healthy, what is the probability that the twin brother is a carrier of the disease allele?

Options:
A. 25% - The probability that the twin brother is a carrier is relatively low, as the disease allele is only present in the twin sister.
B. 50% - Since the disease allele is present in only one of the twins, the probability that the twin brother is a carrier is 50%.
C. 67% - The probability that the twin brother is a carrier is higher than 25% but lower than 50%, as the disease allele is present in only one of the twins.
D. 100% - It is unlikely that the twin brother is a carrier of the disease allele, as the disease is only present in one of the twins.

Answer: B. 50%."
22,"Question: A 12-year-old girl presents to a pediatrician with failure to show signs of breast development. On examination, the pediatrician notes that the girl is shorter than expected for her age and sex, has a webbed neck, low posterior hairline, and broad chest with widely spaced nipples, and has non-pitting bilateral pedal edema. The pediatrician orders a karyotype analysis, which reveals...

Options:

A. A short systolic murmur along the left sternal border in the third and fourth intercostal spaces which radiates to the left infrascapular area
B. A continuous machine-like murmur over the second left intercostal space which radiates to the left clavicle
C. A high-pitched holosystolic murmur over the apical area which radiates to the left axilla
D. A loud and harsh holosystolic murmur which is heard best over the lower left sternal border

Answer: A. A short systolic murmur along the left sternal border in the third and fourth intercostal spaces which radiates to the left infrascapular area.

Explanation: The karyotype analysis reveals that the girl has Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects females and is characterized by monosomy of chromosome 46, X. This condition can result in short stature, webbed neck, low posterior hairline, and broad chest with widely spaced nipples, as well as non-pitting bilateral pedal edema. Auscultation of the chest may reveal a short systolic murmur along the left sternal border in the third and fourth intercostal spaces, which radiates to the left infrascapular area. This murmur is likely due to mitral valve prolapse, a common finding in individuals with Turner syndrome."
23,"Question: Patient 1 – A 26-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for an annual exam. She currently does not have any acute concerns and says her health has been generally well. Medical history is significant for asthma, which is managed with an albuterol inhaler. Her last pap smear was unremarkable. She is currently sexually active with one male and consistently uses condoms. She occasionally smokes marijuana and drinks wine once per week. Her mother recently passed away from advanced ovarian cancer. Her sister is 37-years-old and was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Physical examination is remarkable for a mildly anxious woman.

Patient 2 – A 27-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for an annual exam. She says that she would like to be screened for breast cancer since two of her close friends were recently diagnosed. She noticed she has a small and mobile mass on her left breast, which increases in size and becomes tender around her time of menses. Family history is remarkable for hypertension in the father. The physical exam is significant for a small, well-defined, and mobile mass on her left breast that is not tender to palpation.

Which of the following is the best next step in management for patient 1 and 2?

A. Patient 1 – BRCA testing. Patient 2 – Breast ultrasound
B. Patient 1 – Breast ultrasound. Patient 2 – Return in 3 months for a clinical breast exam
C. Patient 1 – Breast and ovarian ultrasound. Patient 2 – Mammography
D. Patient 1 – CA-125 testing. Patient 2 – BRCA testing

Answer: A. Patient 1 – BRCA testing. Patient 2 – Breast ultrasound

Explanation:

Patient 1 has a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer, with both her mother and sister being diagnosed with these cancers at a young age. BRCA testing is appropriate in this case to assess the patient's risk of inheriting a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, which are associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

Patient 2 has a small, mobile mass on her left breast that increases in size around her time of menses, which is concerning for a possible breast cancer. A breast ultrasound is the next step in management to evaluate the mass and determine if it is likely to be cancerous.

While Patient 1 has a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer, the physical examination findings are not typical of breast cancer. Therefore, a breast ultrasound is the appropriate next step in management, rather than BRCA testing.

Similarly, while Patient 2's family history of hypertension in the father is significant, it is not directly related to breast cancer and does not warrant further testing. A breast ultrasound is the appropriate next step in management to evaluate the mass in her left breast.

Option B is incorrect because a return in 3 months for a clinical breast exam is not a diagnostic test and is not appropriate for either patient.

Option C is incorrect because mammography is a diagnostic test used to evaluate the breasts for signs of breast cancer, but it is not the appropriate next step in management for either patient.

Option D is incorrect because CA-125 is a marker of ovarian cancer, not breast cancer, and is not the appropriate next step in management for either patient."
24,"Question: A 52-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of fatigue, abdominal distension, and swelling of both legs that have persisted for 3 weeks. His medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus and a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with mediastinal radiation 20 years ago. What is the best course of action for this patient?

Options:
A. Pericardiocentesis - This option is incorrect because pericardiocentesis is not a treatment for the patient's symptoms. It is a diagnostic procedure used to drain fluid from the pericardial sac surrounding the heart.

B. Pericardiectomy - This option is the best answer. Pericardiectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing the pericardial sac surrounding the heart, which can help relieve symptoms of pericardial effusion, such as jugular venous distension and chest pain.

C. Pleurodesis - This option is incorrect because pleurodesis is a procedure used to seal off the space between the pleura (the lining of the lungs) and the chest wall, which can help prevent fluid buildup. While pleurodesis may be used in some cases of pericardial effusion, it is not the best treatment for this patient's symptoms.

D. Percutaneous aspiration with high-flow oxygen - This option is also incorrect because percutaneous aspiration with high-flow oxygen is not a treatment for pericardial effusion. It is a procedure used to remove fluid from the chest cavity through a needle inserted into the chest wall, but it is not a substitute for surgical intervention in cases of pericardial effusion."
25,"Question: A 36-year-old woman presents to the physician with an 8-month history of occasional tremor, accompanied by sudden restlessness and nausea, which disrupts her daily work as a professional violinist. The symptoms worsen before upcoming concerts and when she goes for walks in the city, causing her to worry about potentially having a neurological illness and losing her career. She experiences difficulty falling asleep due to persistent worry about burglars, has a good appetite, and drinks one glass of wine before performances to calm her nerves, but otherwise drinks 2-3 glasses of wine per week. Her temperature, pulse, and blood pressure are normal, and she exhibits muscle tension and a fine tremor on both hands upon examination. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?

A. Generalized anxiety disorder: This disorder is characterized by excessive, persistent worry that interferes with daily functioning, and the patient's symptoms of tremor, restlessness, and nausea, as well as her difficulty falling asleep due to worry, are all consistent with this diagnosis.

B. Adjustment disorder: This disorder is a response to a significant change or stressor in a person's life, and the patient's symptoms may include anxiety, depression, and disruptions in daily functioning, which are all relevant to her concerns about her career and potential neurological illness.

C. Panic disorder: This disorder is characterized by recurring panic attacks, which are sudden episodes of intense fear or anxiety that can include physical symptoms such as tremor, and the patient's symptoms of tremor and restlessness, as well as her difficulty falling asleep due to worry, are consistent with this diagnosis.

D. Atypical depressive disorder: This disorder is characterized by depressive symptoms that do not meet the full criteria for major depressive disorder, and the patient's symptoms of tremor, restlessness, and nausea, as well as her difficulty falling asleep due to worry, are all consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's good appetite and drinking habits are not typical of depression."
26,"Question: In which of the following pathological states would the oxygen content of the trachea resemble the oxygen content in the affected alveoli?

Options:
A. Emphysema: The oxygen content of the trachea in emphysema would be expected to be normal, as the destruction of alveolar tissue would not significantly affect the oxygenation of the trachea.
B. Pulmonary fibrosis: The oxygen content of the trachea in pulmonary fibrosis would be expected to be decreased, as the scarring of the alveolar tissue would impair the transfer of oxygen from the alveoli to the trachea.
C. Pulmonary embolism: The oxygen content of the trachea in pulmonary embolism would be expected to be increased, as the obstruction of the pulmonary vessels would lead to an increase in the resistance to blood flow, causing an increase in the oxygenation of the trachea.
D. Foreign body obstruction distal to the trachea: The oxygen content of the trachea in foreign body obstruction distal to the trachea would be expected to be normal, as the obstruction would not significantly affect the oxygenation of the trachea.

Answer: C. Pulmonary embolism."
27,"Sure! Here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 46-year-old man visits his physician due to a 4-month history of progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite. Five years ago, he received a kidney transplant from a living family member. Currently, he is taking sirolimus and mycophenolate. His blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. Laboratory tests reveal normocytic, normochromic anemia and a serum creatinine concentration of 3.1 mg/dL. His vital signs and laboratory tests were normal 6 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's increased creatinine level?

A. Donor T cells causing damage to epithelial cells
B. Preformed antibodies from the recipient damaging endothelial cells
C. CD4+ T cells stimulating intimal smooth muscle proliferation
D. Drug-induced damage to tubular cells

Answer: C. CD4+ T cell-mediated intimal smooth muscle proliferation"
28,"Question: A 68-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after being found unresponsive in her bedroom in a nursing home facility. Her past medical history is relevant for hypertension, diagnosed 5 years ago, for which she has been prescribed a calcium channel blocker and a thiazide diuretic. Upon admission, she is found with a blood pressure of 200/116 mm Hg, a heart rate of 70/min, a respiratory rate of 15/min, and a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F). Her cardiopulmonary auscultation is unremarkable, except for the identification of a 4th heart sound. Neurological examination reveals the patient is stuporous, with eye-opening response reacting only to pain, no verbal response, and flexion withdrawal to pain. Both pupils are symmetric, with the sluggish pupillary response to light. A noncontrast CT of the head is performed and is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?

Format: Question: [Your questions]
Options: [Your options]
Answer: [Your answer], and the format of options should be: A. :[option A]
 B. :[option B]
 C. :[option C]
 D. :[option D].

In this case, the most likely etiology of the patient's condition is:

A. Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm rupture.

The patient's symptoms of unresponsiveness, sluggish pupillary response to light, and the presence of a 4th heart sound on cardiopulmonary auscultation are highly suggestive of a Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm rupture. This is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, leading to bleeding in the brain. The patient's history of hypertension and the presence of a 4th heart sound on auscultation also support this diagnosis. The other options (arteriovenous malformation rupture, dural arteriovenous fistula, and venous sinus thrombosis) are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms based on the information provided in the case."
29,"Question: A 35-year-old woman presents to the physician with a 6-month history of fatigue, fever, joint pain, and a recurrent skin rash on her face. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals a facial rash that spares the nasolabial folds and several oral ulcers, tender joints in the upper and lower extremities with no reddening or swelling, and slight weakness of the proximal muscles. Laboratory studies show the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies. Based on these findings, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms is:

A. Autoantibodies against postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors

Rationale: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that can affect multiple organ systems, including the nervous system. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, fever, joint pain, and skin rash are consistent with SLE, and the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies confirms the diagnosis. Autoantibodies against postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors are not typically associated with SLE.

B. Autoantibodies against myelin

Rationale: SLE can also affect the nervous system, leading to symptoms such as weakness, numbness, and tingling. However, the patient's examination findings of slight weakness of the proximal muscles and tender joints without any signs of demyelination do not support this diagnosis.

C. Upper and lower motor neuron degeneration

Rationale: SLE can cause damage to the nervous system, leading to symptoms of weakness, numbness, and tingling. However, the patient's examination findings of slight weakness of the proximal muscles do not support this diagnosis.

D. Adverse effect of medication

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of fatigue and weakness could be a side effect of the medication used to treat SLE. However, the patient's examination findings and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis."
30,"Question: A 59-year-old male patient presents to the physician with persistent fatigue, myalgia, and a pruritic skin rash over the past 5 months. As a child, he was involved in a motor vehicle accident and received several blood transfusions. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the right upper abdomen, scleral icterus, and bilateral, well-defined, purple, polygonal papules on the wrists. Laboratory tests show an elevated replication rate of a hepatotropic virus, and further analysis reveals high genetic variability in the glycosylated envelope proteins produced by the virus. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the genetic variability observed in these proteins?

A. The viral RNA polymerase lacks proofreading ability, leading to errors in gene replication and diversification of the viral population.
B. The virus incorporates envelope proteins from a second virus, resulting in a mixed genetic makeup and increased genetic variability.
C. The viral genes are integrated into the host cell genome, leading to a new genetic combination and diverse expression of the viral proteins.
D. The patient is infected with multiple viral genotypes, each with its own unique genetic sequence and expression pattern.

Answer: A. Viral RNA polymerase lacks proofreading ability."
31,"Question: The 31-year-old man presents with gradually increasing eccentric behavior and involuntary movements, particularly in his arms and hands, along with difficulty with short-term memory. His past medical history is unremarkable, but his father had similar symptoms before his death at age 33. Physical exam reveals involuntary movements, slow eye movements, and sporadic rigidity. The physician suspects an inherited disorder with progressive onset and increased severity in future generations. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?

Options:
A. Huntington's disease: This is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and family history. Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder that causes progressive damage to the brain, leading to involuntary movements, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbances. The age of onset is typically in the mid-20s to 30s, which is consistent with the patient's age.
B. Friedreich ataxia: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the spinal cord and brain, causing progressive loss of coordination, balance, and mobility. While Friedreich ataxia can also cause involuntary movements, it typically begins in childhood or adolescence, and the patient's age of onset is older than the typical age range for Huntington's disease.
C. Wilson's disease: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the liver and brain, causing progressive damage to the liver and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as involuntary movements, tremors, and cognitive decline. However, the age of onset for Wilson's disease is typically in the second to third decade of life, which is older than the patient's age.
D. Neurofibromatosis: This is a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and causes various symptoms including seizures, developmental delays, and progressive loss of cognitive and motor function. However, the age of onset for neurofibromatosis is typically in the first few decades of life, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Answer: A. Huntington's disease"
32,"Question: An 80-year-old woman presents to an outpatient clinic with a firm nodular lump on the left side of her labia. She has a medical history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and lichen sclerosus of the vagina treated with over-the-counter steroid cream as needed. The patient first noticed the lump 5 months ago. On examination, her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure is 135/89 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respiratory rate is 17/min. Examination of the genital area reveals a small nodular lump on the left labium majus with visible excoriations, but no white plaque-like lesions. What is the next best step in management?

A. HPV DNA testing
B. Estrogen level measurement
C. Pap smear
D. Vulvar punch biopsy

Answer: D. Vulvar punch biopsy

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a possible diagnosis of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), a precancerous condition that can progress to vulvar cancer if left untreated. A vulvar punch biopsy is the next best step in management to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of treatment. HPV DNA testing may be considered in the future to determine the presence of high-risk HPV, which is a risk factor for VIN and vulvar cancer. Estrogen level measurement is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis. A Pap smear is typically performed on the cervix, not the vulva, and may not be necessary in this case."
33,"Question: A newborn infant is born at 42 weeks gestation to a healthy 36-year-old G1P0. The delivery was complicated by prolonged labor and shoulder dystocia. The child is in the 87th and 91st percentiles for height and weight at birth, respectively. The mother’s past medical history is notable for diabetes mellitus and obesity. Immediately after birth, the child’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 24/min. The child demonstrates a strong cry and pink upper and lower extremities bilaterally. The right arm is adducted and internally rotated at the shoulder and extended at the elbow. Flexion and extension of the wrist and digits appear to be intact in the right upper extremity. Which of the following muscles would most likely have normal strength in this patient?

A. Brachialis: The brachialis muscle is located in the upper arm and assists in flexion of the elbow joint. However, given the child's adduction and internal rotation of the right shoulder, it is less likely that the brachialis muscle would have normal strength in this patient.

B. Brachioradialis: The brachioradialis muscle is located in the forearm and assists in flexion of the wrist and fingers. Given the child's normal flexion and extension of the wrist and digits, it is likely that the brachioradialis muscle would have normal strength in this patient.

C. Biceps: The biceps muscle is located in the upper arm and assists in flexion of the elbow joint. However, given the child's adduction and internal rotation of the right shoulder, it is less likely that the biceps muscle would have normal strength in this patient.

D. Triceps: The triceps muscle is located in the upper arm and assists in extension of the elbow joint. Given the child's normal extension of the elbow joint, it is likely that the triceps muscle would have normal strength in this patient.

Answer: D. Triceps"
34,"Question: A 24-year-old man, an information technology professional, gets himself tested for serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels to learn more about his immunity. He knows that IgM levels reflect the status of his immunity, based on what he learned on the internet. Although the laboratory report is normal, he consults a physician. The physician explains human immunity and its essential components. He tells the man that most circulating IgM antibodies in the blood of normal individuals are produced by a specific type of B cell that is primarily found in the peritoneal cavity and mucosal tissues. He also mentions that these cells are components of innate immunity. Which of the following types of B cells does the physician refer to?

A. B-1 B cells
B. Follicular B cells
C. Memory B cells
D. Naïve B cells

Answer: A. B-1 B cells"
35,"Question: A 55-year-old woman presents with symptoms of rectal bleeding and pruritus in the perianal region. She works as a real estate agent and has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). On physical examination, her spleen and liver are enlarged. A blood smear reveals teardrop red blood cells (RBCs), and a leucoerythroblastic picture with the presence of nucleated RBC precursors and immature myeloid cells. A complete blood count shows a normocytic anemia. The physician explains that her condition is due to a JAK2 mutation in one of her chromosomes. What is a characteristic bone marrow aspirate of this condition?

A. Hypercellular bone marrow with fibrosis in later stages
B. Ringed sideroblasts and < 20% of myeloblasts
C. Fibrous tissue with sclerotic spicules observed in early stages
D. Hypocellular bone marrow

Answer: C. Fibrous tissue with sclerotic spicules observed in early stages

Explanation:
The bone marrow aspirate of a patient with a JAK2 mutation in one of their chromosomes will typically show fibrous tissue with sclerotic spicules observed in early stages. This is a characteristic feature of myelofibrosis, a type of bone marrow disorder that is often associated with JAK2 mutations. The fibrous tissue and sclerotic spicules indicate scarring and fibrosis in the bone marrow, which can lead to a decrease in the number of healthy red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets produced in the bone marrow. The bone marrow may also appear hypocellular or hypercellular, depending on the severity of the condition. Ringed sideroblasts and < 20% of myeloblasts are not characteristic features of myelofibrosis. Hypercellular bone marrow with fibrosis in later stages is also not typically seen in the early stages of the disease."
36,"Question: A 59-year-old woman presents to the emergency department 25 minutes after experiencing severe left periorbital pain and blurred vision, which began after attending a movie. She has a headache and has vomited twice en route to the hospital. Two weeks prior, she had acute sinusitis that resolved on its own. She has atrial fibrillation and hypertension and is taking metoprolol and warfarin. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg. Visual acuity is counting fingers at 3 feet in the left eye and 20/20 in the right eye. The left eye shows conjunctival injection and an edematous cornea. The left pupil is mid-dilated and irregular, but not reactive to light. Extraocular movements are normal. Fundoscopic examination is inconclusive due to severe corneal edema. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Angle-closure glaucoma

B. Retrobulbar neuritis

C. Acute iridocyclitis

D. Open-angle glaucoma

Answer: D. Angle-closure glaucoma

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of severe periorbital pain, blurred vision, and mid-dilated and irregular pupillary reaction are consistent with angle-closure glaucoma. The patient's history of acute sinusitis two weeks prior and the presence of hypertension also support this diagnosis. Retrobulbar neuritis and acute iridocyclitis are less likely given the patient's symptoms and medical history. Open-angle glaucoma is also less likely, as the patient's pupillary reaction is not consistent with this diagnosis."
37,"Question: A 32-year-old man presents with hypertension that has been difficult to control with medications. His symptoms include fatigue, frequent waking at night for voiding, and pins and needles in the legs. His symptoms started 2 years ago. Family history is positive for hypertension in his mother. His blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg in the right arm and 165/107 mm Hg in the left arm, pulse is 85/min, and temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F). Physical examination reveals global hyporeflexia and muscular weakness. Lab studies are shown:

Serum sodium 147 mEq/L
Serum creatinine 0.7 mg/dL
Serum potassium 2.3 mEq/L
Serum bicarbonate 34 mEq/L
Plasma renin activity low

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Essential hypertension (A. : This is the most common form of hypertension, which is a chronic increase in blood pressure that is not caused by any underlying medical condition. It is often caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, such as a high-sodium diet, lack of exercise, and stress.)

B. Coarctation of the aorta (B. : This is a congenital heart defect in which there is a narrowing of the aortic arch, which can lead to hypertension in the upper body. It can also cause symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, and shortness of breath.)

C. Primary aldosteronism (C. : This is a rare disorder in which the adrenal glands produce too much aldosterone, a hormone that helps regulate salt and water balance in the body. This can lead to hypertension, as well as symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, and weight gain.)

D. Renal artery stenosis (D. : This is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the kidneys, which can lead to hypertension and kidney damage. It can also cause symptoms such as flank pain and decreased urine output.)

Answer: C. Primary aldosteronism."
38,"Question: A 32-year-old man visits his family physician for persistent left flank pain, weight loss, and fatigue, along with recent hematuria. His mother was diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma at 36 years old, and his father died of a myocardial infarction at 45 years old. On physical examination, the patient shows temporal wasting, pale mucous membranes and palms, a palpable mass in the left flank, and a varicocele that does not reduce upon recumbency. The family physician sends the patient to the emergency department for an abdominal CT scan, which reveals a complex left renal mass and a hemangioblastoma in T10. A biopsy of the renal mass is performed by the oncology team, which demonstrates compact cells with prominent nucleoli, eosinophilic cytoplasm within a network of small and thin-walled vasculature. Based on the biopsy results, what is the most likely type of tumor in this patient?

A. Clear-cell carcinoma

The patient's symptoms, family history, and imaging findings are consistent with a clear-cell carcinoma of the kidney. Clear-cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer that typically affects the distal tubules of the kidney and is characterized by the presence of clear cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. The patient's age, lack of smoking history, and athletic background also support this diagnosis. Therefore, option C is the most likely type of tumor in this patient."
39,"Question: A 75-year-old woman presents with a 6-month history of fatigue, fever, pain in both shoulders and hips, and a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss. She also experiences morning stiffness that lasts for about an hour. The patient has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, and has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Range of motion of the shoulders and hips is reduced due to pain. Examination shows full muscle strength, but the remainder of the examination is unremarkable. Laboratory studies reveal an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 50 mm/h and a C-reactive protein concentration of 25 mg/dL (N=0–10 mg/dL). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Muscle biopsy: This is not the most appropriate next step in management as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has muscle damage or dysfunction.

B. Low-dose of oral prednisone: Given the patient's history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, as well as her recent weight loss and morning stiffness, a low-dose of oral prednisone may be appropriate to help manage her symptoms.

C. Electromyography: This is not the most appropriate next step in management as the patient's symptoms do not suggest any underlying muscle damage or dysfunction that would require electromyography.

D. Antibody screening: This is not the most appropriate next step in management as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has any underlying autoimmune disorders that would require antibody screening.

Answer: B. Low-dose of oral prednisone"
40,"Question: A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department for sudden weakness. The patient states that he was at home enjoying his morning coffee when his symptoms began. He says that his left arm suddenly felt very odd and weak thus prompting him to come to the ED. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, COPD, hypertension, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and PTSD. He recently fell off a horse while horseback riding but claims to not have experienced any significant injuries. He typically drinks 5-7 drinks per day and his last drink was yesterday afternoon. His current medications include insulin, metformin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, albuterol, and fluoxetine. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 93% on room air. On physical exam, you note an elderly man who is mildly confused. Cardiopulmonary exam demonstrates bilateral expiratory wheezes and a systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border that radiates to the carotids. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with finger-nose exam mildly abnormal on the left and heel-shin exam within normal limits. The patient has 5/5 strength in his right arm and 3/5 strength in his left arm. The patient struggles to manipulate objects such as a pen with his left hand. The patient is given a dose of diazepam and started on IV fluids. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

D. Lipohyalinosis

The patient's symptoms of sudden weakness, mild confusion, and difficulty manipulating objects with his left hand are consistent with lipohyialinosis, a condition where fatty deposits accumulate in the muscles, leading to weakness and muscle wasting. The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption and recent fall from a horse may have contributed to the development of lipohyialinosis. The other options, Berry aneurysm rupture, Bridging vein tear, and Hypertensive encephalopathy, are less likely given the patient's presentation and medical history."
41,"Question: A 74-year-old male patient has been experiencing shortness of breath and left-sided back pain for 3 days after undergoing a right hip replacement. He complains of sharp pain with deep breathing. His medical history includes diabetes and hypertension, for which he takes metformin and lisinopril. Upon physical examination, a friction rub is heard best in the left lung base, and his right calf is swollen with erythema and induration. Based on this presentation, which of the following is the most likely status of the patient's lungs?

A. Creation of a shunt
B. Hypoventilation
C. Increased dead space
D. Obstructive lung disease

Answer: C. Increased dead space

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain, along with the physical examination findings of a friction rub in the left lung base and swelling in the right calf, are consistent with a diagnosis of increased dead space. This can occur due to various factors, such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or cardiogenic edema. Given the patient's age and medical history, it is unlikely that he has a shunt, hypoventilation, or obstructive lung disease."
42,"Question: A 19-year-old woman presents to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She has a past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. She recently moved to a new city to begin her undergraduate studies. Her father was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 46. Her father's brother died because of small bowel cancer. Her paternal grandfather died because of stomach cancer. She takes a vitamin supplement. Current medications include esomeprazole and a multivitamin. She smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 3 years but quit 2 years ago. She drinks 1–2 alcoholic beverages on the weekends. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Colonoscopy is unremarkable. Germline testing via DNA sequencing in this patient shows mutations in DNA repair genes MLH1 and MSH2. Which of the following will this patient most likely require at some point in her life?

A. Annual colonoscopy beginning at 20–25 years of age

This patient has a family history of colorectal cancer, with her father and paternal grandfather both diagnosed with stomach cancer, and her father's brother dying of small bowel cancer. Given the presence of mutations in DNA repair genes MLH1 and MSH2, which are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, this patient will most likely require annual colonoscopies beginning at 20–25 years of age to monitor for any potential colorectal cancer.

B. Celecoxib or sulindac therapy

C. Measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19-9 yearly

D. Surgical removal of a desmoid tumor

None of the other options are relevant to this patient's situation. Celecoxib or sulindac therapy are medications used to manage symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, but they are not related to the patient's family history or genetic mutations. Measuring carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19-9 yearly is not a recommended screening test for colorectal cancer in this patient population. Desmoid tumors are rare soft tissue tumors that can occur in the abdomen, but they are not typically associated with a family history of colorectal cancer."
43,"Question: The 51-year-old woman presents with a 1-year history of occasional discoloration and tingling in her fingers. What is the most likely finding in further evaluation of this patient?

Options:
A. Upper eyelid rash
B. Telangiectasia
C. Endocardial immune complex deposition
D. Interstitial lung disease

Answer: B. Telangiectasia.

Explanation: Telangiectasia is a common finding in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect various parts of the body, including the skin. The thickened, waxy skin and firm white nodules on the fingertips are characteristic features of SLE, and the presence of telangiectasia on the fingers suggests a high likelihood of SLE. The other options are less likely to be found in this patient's evaluation."
44,"Question: A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother with complaints of abdominal pain and fever that started 24 hours ago. On further questioning, the mother says that her son vomited twice and has constipation that started approximately 1 and one-half days ago. The medical history is benign. The vital signs are as follows: heart rate 103/min, respiratory rate of 20/min, temperature 38.7°C (101.66°F), and blood pressure 109/69 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is severe right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness on palpation. Which of the following is the most likely cause for this patient's symptoms?

A. Luminal obstruction due to a fecalith: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and constipation, along with the severe right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness, are consistent with a luminal obstruction caused by a fecalith. A fecalith is a small, hard mass that can form in the intestine and cause bowel obstruction, which can lead to abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. The patient's symptoms are more likely to be caused by a fecalith than the other options.

B. Twisting of testes on its axis, hampering the blood supply: This option is not a likely cause for the patient's symptoms. The patient is a male child, and there is no history of testicular pain or twisting.

C. Ascending infection of the urinary tract: While a urinary tract infection (UTI) can cause symptoms such as fever and abdominal pain, the patient's symptoms of constipation and right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness are not typical of a UTI.

D. Immune-mediated vasculitis associated with IgA deposition: This option is not a likely cause for the patient's symptoms. IgA deposition disease is a rare condition that can cause inflammation in the blood vessels, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation. However, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a luminal obstruction caused by a fecalith."
45,"Question: A 53-year-old female presents to her physician with persistent watery diarrhea and recurring episodes of flushing. The patient complains of shortness of breath and during the pulmonary exam, bilateral wheezing is detected.

The ultrasound shows signs of fibrosis in the tricuspid valve with a normal mitral valve. Based on these findings, which metastatic disease is most likely associated with the patient's syndrome?

A. Lung
B. Brain
C. Liver
D. Pancreas

Answer: C. Liver"
46,"Question: A 24-year-old man is hospitalized for an elective gastrointestinal surgery 24 hours before the scheduled day of surgery. The surgeon has ordered food and fluids to be withheld from the patient from 12 hours before the surgery and the administration of intravenous isotonic saline. Based on his body weight, his fluid requirement for 12 hours is 900 mL. However, the following day, the surgeon finds that 3 pints of isotonic fluid (1 pint = 500 mL) were administered over the preceding last 12 hours. Which of the following options best describes the resulting changes in the volume of intracellular fluid (ICF) and the body osmolality of the patient?

Option A: Increased ICF volume, decreased body osmolality

Explanation: When 3 pints of isotonic fluid (500 mL each) are administered over 12 hours, the total volume of intracellular fluid (ICF) in the patient's body increases by 1500 mL (3 x 500 mL). However, the body osmolality remains unchanged as the isotonic fluid has the same osmolar concentration as the patient's blood. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Option B: Decreased ICF volume, no change in body osmolality

Explanation: The patient's fluid requirement of 900 mL for 12 hours is not met, resulting in a decrease in the volume of intracellular fluid (ICF) in the body. However, the body osmolality remains unchanged as there is no significant change in the concentration of solutes in the blood. Therefore, option B is not the correct answer.

Option C: Decreased ICF volume, increased body osmolality

Explanation: If the patient's fluid requirement of 900 mL for 12 hours is not met, leading to a decrease in the volume of intracellular fluid (ICF) in the body, the body osmolality would increase as the concentration of solutes in the blood increases. However, this is not the case as the isotonic fluid administered has the same osmolar concentration as the patient's blood, resulting in no change in body osmolality. Therefore, option C is not the correct answer.

Option D: No change in ICF volume, no change in body osmolality

Explanation: As the patient's fluid requirement of 900 mL for 12 hours is met, there is no change in the volume of intracellular fluid (ICF) in the body. Additionally, the isotonic fluid administered has the same osmolar concentration as the patient's blood, resulting in no change in body osmolality. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
47,"Question: A 53-year-old man presents with a 2-year history of dull, nonspecific flank pain that subsides with rest. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has no allergies and takes no medications. His father died of kidney disease at the age of 51, and his mother has been treated for ovarian cancer. On presentation, his blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg, and his heart rate is 102/min. Abdominal examination is significant for palpable bilateral renal masses. His laboratory tests are significant for creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL and a BUN of 22 mg/dL. Which of the following tests is most recommended in this patient?

A. Stress echocardiography: This test is not recommended in this patient as it is used to evaluate the heart muscle function and structure, and there is no indication to suggest that the patient has any heart disease.

B. Coronary angiography: This test is also not recommended as it is used to evaluate the coronary arteries for blockages, and there is no indication to suggest that the patient has any blockages in the coronary arteries.

C. CT angiography of the head: This test is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and medical history.

D. Serum measurement of alpha-fetoprotein: This test is not recommended as it is used to detect cancer in the body, and there is no indication to suggest that the patient has any cancer.

Answer: C. CT angiography of the head.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of flank pain and palpable bilateral renal masses suggest the possibility of renal cell carcinoma. CT angiography of the head can help to evaluate the renal masses and determine if they are causing any vascular invasion or metastasis to the brain."

49,"Question: A 42-year-old woman presents with episodic abdominal pain and fullness for 1 month. Physical examination reveals hepatomegaly, and abdominal ultrasound shows a 4-cm calcified cyst with several daughter cysts in the liver. She undergoes CT-guided percutaneous aspiration under general anesthesia, and during the procedure, one liver cyst spills, causing a sudden drop in oxygen saturation and a decrease in vital signs. Which of the following parasites is the most likely cause of the patient's condition?

Options:
A. Strongyloides stercoralis - This parasite is known to cause gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain and diarrhea, and can also cause hepatomegaly. However, it is not likely to cause a sudden drop in oxygen saturation or a significant change in vital signs during a diagnostic procedure.
B. Schistosoma mansoni - This parasite can cause hepatomegaly and abdominal pain, but it is less likely to cause a sudden drop in oxygen saturation or a significant change in vital signs during a diagnostic procedure.
C. Clonorchis sinensis - This parasite can cause hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea. However, it is not likely to cause a sudden drop in oxygen saturation or a significant change in vital signs during a diagnostic procedure.
D. Echinococcus granulosus - This parasite can cause hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea. It is also known to cause anaphylactic reactions, which could explain the sudden drop in oxygen saturation and change in vital signs during the diagnostic procedure. Therefore, Echinococcus granulosus is the most likely causal organism of the patient's condition.

Answer: D. Echinococcus granulosus"
50,"Question: A 45-day-old male infant is brought to a pediatrician by his parents with concerns of poor feeding and excessive perspiration for one week. On physical examination, his temperature is 37.7°C (99.8°F), pulse rate is 190/min, and respiratory rate is 70/min. Mild cyanosis is present over the lips, and over the nail beds. Oxygen is provided and his oxygen saturation is carefully monitored. The pediatrician orders a bedside echocardiogram of the infant. It reveals a single arterial trunk arising from 2 normally formed ventricles. The arterial trunk is separated from the ventricles by a single semilunar valve. There is a defect in the interventricular septum, and the arterial trunk overrides the defect. Which of the following congenital heart diseases can also present with similar clinical features?

A. Double-inlet ventricle with unobstructed pulmonary flow: This condition is characterized by two separate ventricular inlets that connect to a single outlet, resulting in equal flow to both lungs. While it can also present with symptoms of poor feeding and excessive perspiration, it is less common than the other options.

B. Infracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous return: This condition occurs when the pulmonary veins fail to connect properly to the right atrium, leading to abnormal blood flow and oxygenation. While it can also cause symptoms of poor feeding and excessive perspiration, it is less likely to be associated with cyanosis than the other options.

C. Severe Ebstein anomaly: This is a rare congenital heart disease characterized by a malformation of the tricuspid valve, which can lead to volume overload and cyanosis. While it can present with symptoms similar to those described, it is more likely to be associated with other symptoms such as difficulty feeding and respiratory distress.

D. Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum: This is a rare condition where the pulmonary valve is absent or malformed, leading to abnormal blood flow and oxygenation. While it can also cause symptoms of poor feeding and excessive perspiration, it is less likely to be associated with cyanosis than the other options.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Double-inlet ventricle with unobstructed pulmonary flow."

52,"Question: A 45-year-old immigrant presents with unintentional weight loss, sleep hyperhidrosis, and a persistent cough. He says these symptoms have been present for quite some time. Upon imaging, many granulomas in the upper lobes are present. It is noted that these apical granulomas have centers of necrosis that appear cheese-like in appearance. Encircling the area of necrosis are large cells with cytoplasms pale in color. Of the following surface markers, which one is specific for these cells?

Options:

A. CD8 - This marker is specific for cytotoxic T cells, which are not typically involved in the immune response to granulomas.
B. CD4 - This marker is specific for helper T cells, which play a role in the immune response to granulomas, but are not as specific as the other options.
C. CD3 - This marker is specific for T cells in general, but does not provide specific information about the type of T cells involved in the immune response to granulomas.
D. CD14 - This marker is specific for macrophages, which are a type of immune cell that plays a key role in the immune response to granulomas. The presence of large cells with pale cytoplasms encircling the area of necrosis is consistent with a macrophage-dominant response to the granuloma.

Answer: D. CD14 - Macrophages are the most likely immune cells involved in the response to the granuloma based on the patient's symptoms and the imaging findings."
53,"Question: A 55-year-old woman presents to her physician with a 4-month history of a painless lump on her neck. Examination reveals a hard nodule on the left side of her neck, and a fine-needle aspiration biopsy shows well-differentiated cuboidal cells arranged spherically around colloid. She undergoes thyroidectomy, and histopathological examination of the surgical specimen reveals invasion of the thyroid capsule and blood vessels. Which of the following cellular events is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?

Options:

A. Activation mutation in the BRAF gene
B. Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene
C. Mutation in the RET proto-oncogene
D. PAX8-PPAR gamma gene rearrangement

Answer: D. PAX8-PPAR gamma gene rearrangement

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and histopathological findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a thyroid tumor, specifically a papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). PTCs are the most common type of thyroid cancer and are characterized by a gradual and invasive growth of well-differentiated thyroid cells. The PAX8-PPAR gamma gene rearrangement is a common genetic alteration in PTCs, occurring in approximately 50% of cases. This rearrangement leads to the activation of the PAX8-PPAR gamma fusion protein, which promotes the proliferation and invasion of the thyroid cells. Therefore, option D is the most likely cellular event involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition."
54,"Question: A 20-year-old woman presents to student health with a 7-day history of sinus congestion, fever, sore throat, and infectious gastroenteritis. She has had similar episodes 2-3 times a year for as long as she can remember, including sinus infections, ear infections, and lung infections. Which of the following immunoglobulin levels would be most likely found in her serum?

Options:
A. IgM Level: Normal, IgG Level: Low, IgA Level: Low
B. IgM Level: Elevated, IgG Level: Low, IgA Level: Low
C. IgM Level: Normal, IgG Level: Normal, IgA Level: Low
D. IgM Level: Normal, IgG Level: Normal, IgA Level: Normal

Answer: C. IgM Level: Normal, IgG Level: Normal, IgA Level: Low.

Explanation:
The patient's history of recurrent sinus, ear, and lung infections, along with the current symptoms of sinus congestion and fever, suggest that she may have a defect in her immune system's ability to produce IgA antibodies. IgA is an important immunoglobulin that plays a key role in the defense against respiratory infections, and low levels of IgA have been associated with recurrent infections. Therefore, the most likely immunoglobulin levels that would be found in the patient's serum are normal IgM and IgG levels, along with low IgA levels."
55,"Question: A 32-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV and a social history of multiple sexual partners presents with new skin findings. His past surgical and family histories are noncontributory. The patient's blood pressure is 129/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 66/min, the respiratory rate is 16/min, and the temperature is 37.5°C (99.6°F). Physical examination reveals numerous painless skin-colored, flattened and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus on physical exam. The application of 5% acetic acid solution causes the lesions to turn white. What is the etiology of these lesions?

A. HPV (types 6 & 11)

The lesions observed in this patient are consistent with condyloma acuminata, a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The application of acetic acid to the lesions confirms the diagnosis, as it causes the lesions to turn white due to the acid's ability to denature the viral proteins. HPV types 6 and 11 are the most common causes of genital warts, and they are usually sexually transmitted through skin-to-skin contact with an infected partner.

B. Neisseria gonorrhoeae

Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a bacterium that can cause gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted infection that can affect the genital, anal, or oropharyngeal areas. However, the symptoms described in the question do not match the characteristics of gonorrhea, which typically involves the presence of purulent discharge, burning during urination, and painful sexual activity.

C. HPV (types 16 & 18)

Human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 are also known to cause genital warts, but they are less common than HPV types 6 and 11. The presence of these viruses can be confirmed through molecular testing, which was not performed in this case.

D. HSV (type 2)

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) can cause genital herpes, a common STI that can cause skin lesions, fever, and other symptoms. However, the symptoms described in the question do not match the characteristics of genital herpes, which typically involve the presence of blisters or sores on the genital area."
56,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 39-year-old man visits the doctor to investigate his hearing loss. He complains of difficulty hearing everyday sounds like the microwave beeping or birds chirping, but can easily make out the pipe organ at church. As an aircraft marshaller, he works in a noisy environment. During a Rinne test, air conduction is found to be greater than bone conduction bilaterally. A Weber test does not lateralize. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's hearing loss?

Options:

A. The tympanic membrane has a hole in it.
B. The stapes is not moving properly.
C. The organ of Corti is damaged.
D. There is too much fluid pressure in the inner ear.

Answer: C. The organ of Corti is damaged."
57,"Question: A 33-year-old man visits his psychiatrist with feelings of sadness on most days of the week for the past 4 weeks. He says that he is unable to participate in his daily activities and finds it hard to get out of bed on most days. If he has nothing scheduled for the day, he sometimes sleeps for 10–12 hours at a stretch. He has also noticed that on certain days, his legs feel heavy and he finds it difficult to walk, as though there are bricks tied to his feet. However, he is still able to attend social events and also enjoys playing with his children when he comes home from work. Other than these simple pleasures, he has lost interest in most of the activities he previously enjoyed. Another troubling fact is that he had gained weight over the past month, mainly because he eats so much when overcome by these feelings of depression. His is prescribed a medication to treat his symptoms. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the drug he was most likely prescribed?

A. Inhibit the uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine at the presynaptic cleft

B. Non-selectively inhibits monoamine oxidase A and B

C. Stimulates the release of norepinephrine and dopamine in the presynaptic cleft

D. Works as an antagonist at the dopamine and serotonin receptors

Answer: B. Non-selectively inhibits monoamine oxidase A and B

Explanation: The medication most likely prescribed to the patient is an MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor), which non-selectively inhibits both monoamine oxidase A and B. This means that the drug will increase the levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain, which can help to alleviate symptoms of depression."
58,"Question: A 28-year-old man presents to the emergency department after being rescued from his home following a wall collapse. He reports mild confusion and pain in his legs with superficial abrasions. A CT scan reveals small fractures in both tibias but no hematomas. His urine output over the past 24 hours is 200 mL, with a creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL and serum creatine kinase (CK) of 29,700 IU/L. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?

Options:

A. Order anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titers - Incorrect. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest an autoimmune disorder, so ordering ANA titers is not necessary at this time.

B. Order anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) titers - Incorrect. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a diagnosis of membranous nephropathy, so ordering GBM titers is not necessary at this time.

C. Order anti-streptolysin O titers - Incorrect. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a diagnosis of strep throat or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, so ordering anti-streptolysin O titers is not necessary at this time.

D. Start IV fluids - Correct. The patient's urine output is low, and his creatinine level is elevated, suggesting possible acute kidney injury. Starting IV fluids is the next best step in the management of this patient to help maintain hydration and potentially prevent further worsening of the patient's kidney function."
59,"Question: A 62-year-old woman is hospitalized for an open reduction of a fracture of her right femur following a motor vehicle accident 2 hours prior. She has had rheumatoid arthritis for 12 years. She was hospitalized 1 month ago for an exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis. Since then, she has been taking a higher dose of prednisone to control the flare. Her other medications include calcium supplements, methotrexate, and etanercept. She has had appropriate nutrition over the years with regular follow-ups with her healthcare providers. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiovascular examination shows no abnormalities. In order to reduce the risk of post-operative wound failure, which of the following is the most appropriate modification in this patient's drug regimen?

Options:

A. Adding zinc supplementation: Zinc supplementation may help to reduce the risk of wound complications, but it is not the most appropriate modification in this patient's drug regimen.

B. Discontinuing steroids before surgery: Discontinuing steroids before surgery may increase the risk of wound failure, as steroids can suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection. Therefore, this option is not the most appropriate.

C. Increasing prednisone dose initially and tapering rapidly after 3 days: Increasing the dose of prednisone initially and tapering it rapidly after 3 days may help to reduce the risk of infection and wound failure, as prednisone can help to boost the immune system. However, it is important to note that tapering the dose too quickly can lead to a rebound effect, which may increase the risk of infection. Therefore, this option is a potential solution, but it requires careful consideration and monitoring.

D. Replacing prednisone with hydrocortisone: Replacing prednisone with hydrocortisone may be a better option, as hydrocortisone has a more gradual tapering effect compared to prednisone. This can help to reduce the risk of rebound effect and may be more effective in preventing infection and wound failure.

Answer: D. Replacing prednisone with hydrocortisone."
60,"Question: A 61-year-old male presents to the emergency department with blisters on multiple areas of his body, which he developed after hiking in the mountains with his colleagues. He has a history of recent infection and confusion of his medication with his wife's blood thinner pills. On examination, the blisters are flesh-colored, raised, and widespread on his skin, but do not involve his mucosal surfaces. They are tense to palpation and do not separate with rubbing. The pathology of the vesicles shows that they continue under the level of the epidermis. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's blistering?

A. Antibodies to proteins connecting intermediate filaments to type IV collagen
B. Antibodies to proteins connecting two sets of intermediate filaments
C. Depletion of protein C and protein S levels
D. Necrosis of skin in reaction to a drug

Answer: A. Antibodies to proteins connecting intermediate filaments to type IV collagen

Rationale: The patient's blisters are likely caused by antibodies to proteins connecting intermediate filaments to type IV collagen, as this condition is characterized by the formation of blisters and bullae on the skin. This is a rare autoimmune disorder called bullous pemphigoid, which occurs when the body produces antibodies that attack the proteins that hold the skin together. The patient's history of recent infection and confusion of his medication with his wife's blood thinner pills may have triggered the onset of the blisters, but the underlying cause is the autoimmune response. The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and medical history."
61,"Question: A 46-year-old male presents with his wife to his primary care provider for depression and strange movements. His wife reports that her husband has not been himself for the last two months. Whereas he was previously outgoing and “the life of the party,” the patient is now irritable and withdrawn. He is a partner at an accounting firm, but his colleagues are threatening his job if he continues to perform poorly at work. The patient cannot explain the recent changes to his mood and tearfully admits he fears there is something seriously wrong with him. His wife says that she thinks he is getting worse. The patient’s past medical history is significant for hypertension, for which he takes lisinopril. His family history is unknown as he was adopted. The patient met his mother once, and never knew his father but was told he died in his 50's. He drinks a few glasses of wine per week and has never smoked. On physical exam, the patient has a flat affect with facial grimace and sudden jerky movements of his upper extremities.

Which of the following is most likely to be seen on further workup?

D. Dorsal striatum atrophy on head CT

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms of depression, irritability, and sudden jerky movements of his upper extremities are concerning for a movement disorder such as Parkinson's disease. The patient's history of hypertension and lack of smoking history also support this diagnosis. A head CT scan would be likely to reveal dorsal striatum atrophy, which is a hallmark finding of Parkinson's disease.

Option A, the positive 14-3-3 CSF assay, is not a reliable diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease as it is not specific to the disease and can be elevated in other conditions.

Option B, alpha-synuclein aggregates on brain biopsy, is a diagnostic feature of Parkinson's disease, but it is not typically evaluated on a routine head CT scan.

Option C, neurofibrillary tangles on brain biopsy, is a diagnostic feature of Alzheimer's disease, but it is not typically evaluated on a routine head CT scan.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and medical history is Parkinson's disease, and a head CT scan would be the most appropriate next step in the workup."
62,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 52-year-old man with stage IV melanoma visits the physician for a routine follow-up examination with his wife by his side. Despite receiving aggressive chemotherapy, he has recently been diagnosed with new bone and brain metastases. The patient has not informed his wife of this development, but has given verbal consent to discuss his prognosis with her. As the physician, how would you begin the interview with the patient's wife?

Options:
A. ""What is your understanding of your husband's current condition?""
B. ""Have you and your husband discussed a living will or goals of care together?""
C. ""We should talk about how we can manage your husband's symptoms with additional chemotherapy.""
D. ""Your husband has end-stage cancer, and his prognosis is poor.""

Answer: A. ""What is your understanding of your husband's current condition?"""
63,"Question: A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with swelling of her face and abdominal pain. She states she was outside doing yard work when her symptoms began. The patient has a past medical history of recently diagnosed diabetes and hypertension. Her current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 149/95 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On physical exam, the patient's cardiac and pulmonary exam are within normal limits. Dermatologic exam reveals edema of her hands, lips, and eyelids. There is mild laryngeal edema; however, the patient is speaking clearly and maintaining her airway. Which of the following is appropriate long-term management of this patient?

A. Fresh frozen plasma: Fresh frozen plasma is not a recommended long-term management option for this patient. Fresh frozen plasma is used to treat bleeding disorders, but the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a bleeding disorder.

B. Ecallantide: Ecallantide is not a recommended long-term management option for this patient. Ecallantide is a rapid-acting agent used to treat hereditary angioedema, but the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this condition.

C. Danazol: Danazol is an appropriate long-term management option for this patient. Danazol is a synthetic androgen that can help to reduce the symptoms of angioedema, which is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors like lisinopril.

D. Discontinue metformin: Discontinuing metformin is not a recommended long-term management option for this patient. Metformin is a commonly used medication for type 2 diabetes, and discontinuing it without a replacement medication could lead to worsening hyperglycemia.

Answer: C. Danazol"

B. Upregulation of neutrophil adhesion molecules, downregulation of neutrophil destruction in the bone marrow, and decreased production of neutrophils.
C. Downregulation of neutrophil adhesion molecules and decreased production of neutrophils in the bone marrow.
D. Upregulation of neutrophil release from the bone marrow, increased destruction of neutrophils, and upregulation of neutrophil adhesion molecules.

Answer: A. ↑ activation of neutrophil adhesion molecules, ↓ release of neutrophils in the bone marrow, and ↑ destruction of neutrophils."
65,"Question: A 51-year-old man presents to the urgent care center with a blood pressure of 201/111 mm Hg, complaining of a severe headache and chest pain. Physical examination reveals regular heart sounds and clear bilateral lung sounds. Ischemic changes are noted on his electrocardiogram (ECG). What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's high blood pressure?

Options:

A. Oral beta-blocker - lower mean arterial pressure no more than 25% over the 1st hour
B. IV labetalol - redose until blood pressure within normal limits
C. IV labetalol - lower mean arterial pressure no more than 50% over the 1st hour
D. IV labetalol - lower mean arterial pressure no more than 25% over the 1st hour

Answer: D. IV labetalol - lower mean arterial pressure no more than 25% over the 1st hour

Explanation:

In this scenario, the patient is presenting with severe hypertension and is at risk of cerebral ischemia due to the ischemic changes noted on the ECG. Labetalol is a beta-blocker that can effectively lower blood pressure in emergency situations, and the IV route of administration allows for rapid onset of action. The most appropriate treatment for this patient's high blood pressure is therefore IV labetalol, with the goal of lowering the mean arterial pressure by no more than 25% over the first hour. This will help to reduce the risk of cerebral ischemia and other complications associated with severe hypertension."
66,"Question: A 62-year-old woman returns for a follow-up examination after adjusting her medication regimen. She feels well, but has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, essential tremor, and chronic back pain. Her current medications include metformin, glyburide, propranolol, simvastatin, ramipril, amitriptyline, and ibuprofen. Her fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 47 mg/dL, which is confirmed by serum studies. Which pharmacological mechanism is most likely responsible for the absence of symptoms in this patient?

A. Inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake
B. Blockade of β2-adrenergic receptors
C. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme
D. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase

Answer: B. Blockade of β2-adrenergic receptors

Explanation: The patient's medication regimen includes propranolol, which is a β-blocker that blocks the action of catecholamines, such as norepinephrine, on β2-adrenergic receptors. By blocking these receptors, propranolol can reduce the symptoms of essential tremor, which is the most likely explanation for the absence of symptoms in this patient. The other options are not as relevant to the patient's condition."

He reports no expectoration, chest pain, weight loss, or breathlessness, and denies any recent travel or sick contacts. His past medical history includes chronic constipation. He has a 15-pack-year smoking history but denies any alcohol or current recreational drug use, although he did use intravenous drugs in his late twenties and completed a drug rehabilitation program. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory findings and a chest radiograph are normal. Which of the following would be the best choice as a cough suppressant in this patient?

Options:

A. Codeine: Codeine is an opioid medication that can help to suppress cough. However, it may not be the best choice for this patient due to his history of intravenous drug use and the potential for addiction.

B. Dextromethorphan: Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant that can help to relieve a persistent cough. It is available over-the-counter and has a good safety profile when used as directed. Given the patient's history of chronic constipation, dextromethorphan may be a good option.

C. Pseudoephedrine: Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that can help to relieve nasal congestion and cough. However, it may not be the best choice for this patient due to his history of intravenous drug use and the potential for addiction.

D. Oxymetazoline: Oxymetazoline is a decongestant that can help to relieve nasal congestion and cough. However, it may not be the best choice for this patient due to its potential for rebound congestion and the risk of tolerance.

68,"Question: A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with crushing substernal chest pain. The patient has a past medical history of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. He drinks 5 alcoholic drinks every night and has a 40 pack-year smoking history. The patient works as a truck driver and leads a sedentary lifestyle. His initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is notable for ST elevation in V2-V5 with reciprocal changes. The patient is sent for cardiac catheterization, and several stents are placed. The patient is being monitored after the procedure, when he suddenly becomes less responsive. His temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 87/48 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Jugular venous distension is absent and pulmonary exam is notable for clear breath sounds bilaterally. The patient states that he is experiencing back and flank pain and is tender to palpation over his lumbar back and flanks. The patient is given 3 liters of Lactated Ringer solution and his blood pressure improves to 110/70 mmHg and his pulse is 95/min. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

A. CT scan: Given the patient's sudden loss of responsiveness and the presence of back and flank pain, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis should be performed to evaluate for any underlying causes of these symptoms, such as a hemorrhagic or infarcted abdominal organ.

B. Emergency surgery: Given the patient's sudden loss of responsiveness and the presence of back and flank pain, emergency surgery may be necessary to address any underlying conditions that may be causing these symptoms.

C. FAST exam: A FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) exam should be performed to evaluate for any intra-abdominal injuries or bleeding.

D. Repeat cardiac catheterization: Given the patient's recent cardiac catheterization and the improvement in his blood pressure and pulse rate after fluid resuscitation, repeat cardiac catheterization is not the next step in management."
69,"Question: A 48-year-old woman presents to the physician with a 6-month history of muscle stiffness, myalgia, and a 7-kg (15-lb) weight gain. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago. Physical examination reveals cold, dry skin, and proximal muscle weakness. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally with delayed relaxation. The creatine kinase level is 2,940 U/L. What is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A. Thyroid function tests - This is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis as the patient's symptoms of muscle stiffness, myalgia, and weight gain could be indicative of hypothyroidism. Thyroid function tests can help determine if the patient's thyroid hormone levels are within the normal range and if there is any evidence of hypothyroidism.

B. Muscle biopsy - A muscle biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of myopathy, which is a muscle disorder that can cause muscle weakness and stiffness. However, this option is not as relevant to the patient's symptoms as thyroid function tests.

C. Serum electrolytes - Electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and chloride are important for muscle function and can be affected in various muscle disorders. However, the patient's symptoms of muscle stiffness and myalgia suggest that the most likely cause is a muscle disorder rather than an electrolyte imbalance.

D. Repetitive nerve stimulation - This option is not relevant to the patient's symptoms as the patient's muscle stiffness and myalgia are not indicative of a nerve disorder.

Answer: A. Thyroid function tests"
70,"Question: A 19-year-old woman visits the doctor due to a 2-day lack of sleep, worrying it will negatively impact her career as a model. She has been making frequent visits to the doctor for minor issues over the past year, often dressed extravagantly and flirting with the receptionist. When asked to wait in the waiting room, she begins to cry and claims no one listens to her. When called to the examination room, she moves close to the doctor and attempts to touch their cheek, making inappropriate comments. She has no history of self-harm or suicidal ideation. Based on this information, which of the following diagnoses is most likely?

A. Dependent personality disorder
B. Histrionic personality disorder - This diagnosis is most likely due to the woman's flirtatious behavior, emotional intensity, and difficulty regulating her emotions. Her tendency to move close to the doctor and attempt to touch their cheek also aligns with the diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder.
C. Narcissistic personality disorder - While the woman's flirting behavior could be seen as narcissistic, the lack of evidence for grandiosity, self-importance, and a fixation with fantasies of unlimited success and power suggests this diagnosis is less likely.
D. Borderline personality disorder - While the woman's emotional intensity and difficulty regulating her emotions are present, the lack of evidence for impulsive behavior, unstable relationships, and a fear of abandonment suggests this diagnosis is also less likely."
71,"Question: How does your nephrologist evaluate the progression of your kidney failure?

Options:
A. Glucose: The clearance of glucose is not a reliable estimate for GFR as it is affected by factors such as insulin resistance and other comorbidities.
B. Inulin: Inulin is a more accurate estimate for GFR compared to glucose as it is not affected by insulin resistance and has a longer half-life, allowing for more accurate measurements.
C. Paraaminohippurate (PAH): PAH is a synthetic marker that is excreted primarily by the kidneys and can be used to estimate GFR. However, it may not be as accurate as inulin in some cases.
D. Sodium: Sodium levels are not directly related to GFR and cannot be used to estimate kidney function.

Answer: B. Inulin"
72,"Question: A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency room complaining of severe nausea and vomiting. He returned from a business trip to Nigeria five days ago and has developed progressively worsening fevers, headache, nausea, and vomiting. He has lost his appetite and cannot hold down food or water. He did not receive any vaccinations before traveling. His medical history is notable for alcohol abuse and peptic ulcer disease for which he takes omeprazole regularly. His temperature is 103.0°F (39.4°C), blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, pulse is 128/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical examination reveals scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, and tenderness to palpation in the right and left upper quadrants. While in the examination room, he vomits up dark vomitus. The patient is admitted and started on multiple anti-protozoal and anti-bacterial medications. Serology studies are pending; however, the patient dies soon after admission. The virus that likely gave rise to this patient’s condition is part of which of the following families?

A. Flavivirus: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a flavivirus infection, such as yellow fever, dengue fever, or chikungunya. These viruses are known to cause severe fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting, as well as hepatomegaly and scleral icterus. The patient's recent travel to Nigeria also increases the likelihood of a flavivirus infection.

B. Calicivirus: While caliciviruses are not typically associated with severe vomiting and hepatomegaly, they can cause similar symptoms such as fever, headache, and nausea. However, the patient's recent travel to Nigeria and the presence of scleral icterus and hepatomegaly suggest a more severe infection, which is more consistent with a flavivirus infection.

C. Bunyavirus: Bunyaviruses are known to cause severe fever, headache, and muscle and joint pain, but they are less likely to cause nausea and vomiting. The patient's recent travel to Nigeria and the presence of scleral icterus and hepatomegaly do not fit with the typical presentation of a bunyavirus infection.

D. Hepevirus: Hepeviruses are known to cause mild symptoms such as fever, headache, and fatigue, but they are not typically associated with severe vomiting, hepatomegaly, or scleral icterus. The patient's recent travel to Nigeria and the presence of these severe symptoms suggest a more severe infection, which is more consistent with a flavivirus infection.

Therefore, the answer is A. Flavivirus."
73,"Question: A previously healthy 29-year-old African-American male presents with a 2-week history of progressive fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion, along with yellowing of the eyes and dark urine. He has a family history of type II diabetes, but denies changes in urinary frequency, dysuria, or nocturia. His temperature is 37°C (98.6° F), blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, and heart rate is 80/min. Examination reveals pale conjunctivae, splenomegaly, and jaundice, with no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory studies show:

Hematocrit: 19.5%
Hemoglobin: 6.5 g/dL
WBC count: 11,000/mm3
Platelet count: 300,000/mm3
Reticulocyte count: 8%
Serum:

Total bilirubin: 6 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin: 1.0 mg/dL
Urea nitrogen: 9 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1 mg/dL
Lactate dehydrogenase: 365 U/L
Peripheral blood smear shows gross polychromasia with nucleated red blood cells and spherocytes. Direct Coombs' test is positive.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Hereditary spherocytosis
B. Alpha thalassemia
C. Spur cell hemolytic anemia
D. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia

Answer: D. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and jaundice, along with the laboratory findings of anemia, reticulocytosis, and positive direct Coombs' test, are consistent with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The patient's family history of type II diabetes also increases the likelihood of an autoimmune disorder. Hereditary spherocytosis, alpha thalassemia, and spur cell hemolytic anemia are less likely causes based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results."
74,"Question: A 2-week-old infant is brought to the emergency room because of 4 episodes of bilious vomiting and inconsolable crying for the past 3 hours. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. An upper GI contrast series shows the duodenojejunal junction to the right of the vertebral midline; an air-filled cecum is noted in the right upper quadrant. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?

Options:

A. Failure of duodenal recanalization - This option is unlikely, as the upper GI contrast series shows the duodenojejunal junction to be in the right position.

B. Incomplete intestinal rotation - This is the most likely cause of the patient's condition. Intestinal rotation is a crucial process in fetal development, and incomplete rotation can result in abnormalities in the positioning of the intestines, including the duodenojejunal junction. The presence of an air-filled cecum in the right upper quadrant is consistent with this diagnosis.

C. Arrested rotation of ventral pancreatic bud - This option is not supported by the given information. There is no mention of any abnormalities in the pancreas or its rotation.

D. Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pyloric sphincter - This option is also unlikely, as there is no mention of any abnormalities in the pyloric sphincter or its surrounding tissues.

Answer: B. Incomplete intestinal rotation"
75,"Question: A 9-year-old boy presents to the physician with a 3-day history of fever, sore throat, and itchy, red eyes. He was at summer camp when symptoms began, and his immunizations are not up-to-date. On examination, there is erythema and edema of the conjunctivae and posterior pharyngeal wall, as well as bilateral, tender preauricular lymphadenopathy. Further evaluation reveals infection with a DNA virus. Which of the following is the most likely causative pathogen?

Options:
A. Adenovirus - This virus is known to cause a range of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, including conjunctivitis and lymphadenopathy.
B. Parvovirus - Parvovirus B19 is a common cause of Fifth disease, which presents with fever, sore throat, and a characteristic ""slapped cheek"" rash on the face.
C. Picornavirus - Picornaviruses are responsible for a variety of viral infections, including the common cold and gastroenteritis.
D. Paramyxovirus - Paramyxoviruses are known to cause respiratory infections, including pneumonia and bronchiolitis, but are less commonly associated with conjunctivitis and lymphadenopathy.

Answer: A. Adenovirus."
76,"Question: A 34-year-old woman with no significant prior medical history presents to the clinic with several days of bloody stool. She also complains of constipation and straining, but she has no other symptoms. She has no family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure is 121/81 mm Hg, heart rate is 77/min, and respiratory rate is 15/min. There is no abdominal discomfort on physical exam, and a digital rectal exam reveals bright red blood. Of the following, which is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Colorectal cancer - This is the most likely diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms of bloody stool and constipation, as well as the lack of other symptoms. Colorectal cancer can cause bleeding due to ulcers or polyps in the colon or rectum.

B. Ulcerative colitis - This inflammatory bowel disease can cause bloody stool, abdominal pain, and weight loss. However, the patient's lack of abdominal discomfort and the presence of bright red blood on digital rectal exam suggest that ulcerative colitis is less likely.

C. Anal fissure - This condition can cause painful defecation and bright red blood on the stool. However, the patient's lack of abdominal discomfort and the presence of constipation suggest that an anal fissure is less likely.

D. Internal hemorrhoids - Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the rectum or anus that can cause bleeding, especially during bowel movements. However, the patient's bright red blood on digital rectal exam and the lack of other symptoms suggest that internal hemorrhoids are less likely.

Answer: D. Internal hemorrhoids."
77,"Question: A 62-year-old woman presents to the clinic for a 2-month history of ‘fogginess’, including forgetfulness, low mood, and unintentional weight loss. What is the most likely underlying pathology?

Options:
A. Endocrine - This option suggests that the patient's symptoms are related to a hormonal imbalance, such as hypoparathyroidism or hyperthyroidism. However, the patient's laboratory results show normal levels of thyroid hormones and parathyroid hormone, making this option less likely.

B. Inflammatory - This option suggests that the patient's symptoms are related to an inflammatory process, such as an autoimmune disorder or infection. However, the patient's laboratory results show no evidence of inflammation, and her physical exam is unremarkable, making this option less likely.

C. Neoplastic - This option suggests that the patient's symptoms are related to a malignancy, such as lung cancer or breast cancer. The patient's history of smoking for 40 years and unintentional weight loss increase the likelihood of this option. However, the patient's laboratory results show no evidence of cancer, and her physical exam is unremarkable, making this option less likely.

D. Toxicity (exogenous) - This option suggests that the patient's symptoms are related to exposure to a toxic substance, such as heavy metal poisoning or pesticide exposure. However, the patient's laboratory results show no evidence of toxicity, and her history of smoking and unintentional weight loss do not suggest this option.

Answer: C. Neoplastic - The patient's history of smoking and unintentional weight loss increase the likelihood of a malignancy, such as lung cancer or breast cancer, as the underlying pathology. While the patient's laboratory results show no evidence of cancer, the presence of a bothersome cough and unintentional weight loss are concerning signs that warrant further investigation."
78,"Question: A 50-year-old man presents to the physician with recurrent chest pain, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, and weight loss over the past two months. He also experiences muscle pain, joint pain, and fatigue. Five years ago, he was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B infection and is currently taking tenofovir. On examination, he has several ulcerations around his ankles and calves. Laboratory tests reveal:

Hemoglobin: 11 g/dL
Leukocyte count: 14,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 80 mm/h
Serum:
Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies: Negative
Hepatitis B surface antigen: Positive
Urine:
Protein: +2
RBC: 6-7/hpf

Which of the following conditions is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Takayasu arteritis
B. Giant cell arteritis
C. Polyarteritis nodosa
D. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

Answer: C. Polyarteritis nodosa.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of recurrent chest pain, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, and weight loss are consistent with the symptoms of polyarteritis nodosa, a rare autoimmune disease that affects the medium-sized and small arteries. The presence of ulcerations around the ankles and calves is also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of chronic hepatitis B infection and current treatment with tenofovir may suggest a possible association with polyarteritis nodosa.

Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis are all inflammatory conditions that affect the blood vessels, but they have different clinical presentations and laboratory findings. Takayasu arteritis primarily affects the aorta and its major branches, while giant cell arteritis primarily affects the large and medium-sized arteries. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a more generalized condition that affects multiple organ systems, including the blood vessels.

In conclusion, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is polyarteritis nodosa."

80,"Question: A 57-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for weakness. The patient states that she barely feels able to lift a bag of groceries from her car into her house anymore. The patient has a past medical history of a suicide attempt, constipation, anxiety, asthma, and atopic dermatitis. Her current medications include fluoxetine, lisinopril, albuterol, diphenhydramine, sodium docusate, and a multivitamin. She was recently started on atorvastatin for dyslipidemia. Her temperature is 97°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 90/65 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, you note a fatigued appearing woman with thinning hair. Cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. She demonstrates 3/5 strength in her upper and lower extremities with 1+ sluggish reflexes. Sensation is symmetrical and present in the upper and lower extremities. Pain/tenderness upon palpation of the patient's extremities is noted. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below:

Hemoglobin: 12 g/dL
Hematocrit: 36%
Leukocyte count: 5,500/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 190,000/mm^3

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 101 mEq/L
K+: 4.4 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 90 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.1 mg/dL
AST: 12 U/L
ALT: 10 U/L

Which of the following is the best next step in management?

C. TSH level

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history of weakness, fatigue, and ataxia, the next step in management would be to evaluate for an underlying neurological disorder. The patient's recent suicide attempt and history of anxiety and depression also suggest a potential psychiatric component. A TSH level would be appropriate to rule out hypothyroidism, which can present with similar symptoms.

Option A, discontinuing atorvastatin, is not a reasonable next step as there is no indication that this medication is causing the patient's symptoms.

Option B, coenzyme Q10, is not a treatment for weakness or fatigue and is not relevant to the patient's presentation.

Option D, muscle biopsy, is an invasive and expensive test that is not necessary at this time and would not provide additional diagnostic information."
81,"Question: A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, and other symptoms. Which of the following best describes the underlying condition of this patient?

Options:
A. Bowel wall spasticity
B. p-ANCA positive autoimmune bowel disease
C. Rectal mucosa outpouching
D. Transmural granulomas in the bowel

Answer: D. Transmural granulomas in the bowel

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, and the presence of multiple painful shallow ulcers in the mouth, along with the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, suggest the presence of an inflammatory condition in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The patient's history of consuming undercooked meats on a camping trip in the Rocky Mountains is also consistent with the diagnosis of a GI infection or inflammation.

The other options do not adequately explain the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Bowel wall spasticity is a condition characterized by abnormal contractions of the bowel wall, which can cause abdominal pain but not the other symptoms presented by the patient. p-ANCA positive autoimmune bowel disease is a rare condition that can cause inflammation in the GI tract, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest this diagnosis. Rectal mucosa outpouching is a rare condition characterized by the protrusion of mucosa from the rectum, which can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain and rectal bleeding, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely underlying condition in this patient is transmural granulomas in the bowel, which can cause inflammation and damage to the GI tract, leading to abdominal pain, fever, and other symptoms."
82,"Question: A 26-year-old woman visits the clinic complaining of a headache, runny nose, and general malaise. As the interview progresses, she reveals that she has started her first job but is struggling to keep up with the workload due to numerous pending papers to correct. Despite being advised to seek help from other teachers, she insists that she must do it her way to ensure it's done correctly. This is impacting her performance at work and putting her at risk of being asked to leave. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

Options:
A. Ego-syntonic obsessive-compulsive personality disorder - This diagnosis is likely given the patient's strong belief that she must do things her way and her difficulty in delegating tasks to others, which are hallmarks of ego-syntonic obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.

B. Ego-syntonic obsessive-compulsive disorder - Similar to the previous option, this diagnosis is also plausible given the patient's insistence on doing things her way and the presence of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.

C. Ego-dystonic obsessive-compulsive disorder - While the patient's beliefs and behaviors may be causing significant distress, this diagnosis is less likely as the patient does not appear to have a strong desire to avoid her obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.

D. Personality disorder not otherwise specified - This diagnosis is possible given the patient's difficulty in managing her workload and maintaining her job, but further evaluation and assessment would be needed to determine the specific personality disorder present."
83,"Question: An investigator studying mechanisms of acquired antibiotic resistance in bacteria conducts a study using isolated strains of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The E. coli strain harbors plasmid pRK212.1, which conveys resistance to kanamycin. The S. aureus strain is susceptible to kanamycin. Both bacterial strains are mixed in a liquid growth medium containing deoxyribonuclease. After incubation for 2 days and subsequent transfer to a solid medium, the S. aureus colonies show no lysis in response to the application of kanamycin. Analysis of chromosomal DNA from the kanamycin-resistant S. aureus strain does not reveal the kanamycin-resistance gene. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this finding?

A. Transformation: Transformation is the process by which a foreign DNA molecule is taken up by a bacterial cell through direct contact or by a vector such as a plasmid. However, the absence of the kanamycin-resistance gene in the chromosomal DNA of the S. aureus strain suggests that transformation is not the mechanism responsible for the acquired resistance in this case.

B. Conjugation: Conjugation is the process by which a plasmid or other mobile genetic element is transferred from one bacterial cell to another through direct contact or by a vector such as a pilus. The presence of plasmid pRK212.1 in the E. coli strain and the lack of the kanamycin-resistance gene in the chromosomal DNA of the S. aureus strain suggest that conjugation is the most likely mechanism responsible for the acquired resistance in this case.

C. Transposition: Transposition is the process by which a gene is moved from one location in a chromosome to another. However, the absence of the kanamycin-resistance gene in the chromosomal DNA of the S. aureus strain suggests that transposition is not the mechanism responsible for the acquired resistance in this case.

D. Transduction: Transduction is the process by which a gene is transferred from one bacterial cell to another through a virus or other vector. However, the absence of the kanamycin-resistance gene in the chromosomal DNA of the S. aureus strain suggests that transduction is not the mechanism responsible for the acquired resistance in this case.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism responsible for the acquired resistance in the S. aureus strain is conjugation."
84,"Question: A 53-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a 1-month history of a ‘pounding’ in her head and neck and swelling of her feet. She has frequent episodes of diffuse wheezing that occur sporadically without known triggers and last for 1–2 hours. She was recently prescribed albuterol by an external physician but it did not improve her symptoms. She previously walked 2–3 blocks per day for exercise but now complains of dizziness, fatigue, and trouble breathing after walking only 1 block. On review of systems, she confirms a recent history of watery, nonbloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps. She eats a well-balanced diet of meat, dairy, eggs, fish, vegetables, and cereal grains. She has never used alcohol, tobacco, or other recreational drugs. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the blood pressure is 146/88 mm Hg, the heart rate is 89/min, the respiratory rate is 20/min. Abdominal exam reveals minor, diffuse tenderness to palpation without guarding or rebound. She has jugular venous distention and bilateral pedal edema. There are a few telangiectasias over her chest and abdomen. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac auscultation along the left sternal border in the 3rd–4th intercostal space reveals the following sound. At the end of the physical examination, her face suddenly becomes erythematous and warm and she begins wheezing. Which of the following is the most likely side effect of the first-line medication used to manage her condition?

A. Thromboembolism: Thromboembolism is a possible side effect of albuterol, which can cause blood clots to form in the lungs. However, this is not the most likely side effect in this patient's case, as she does not have any history of cardiovascular disease or risk factors for thromboembolism.

B. Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis is a possible side effect of albuterol, which can cause inflammation of the pancreas. However, this is not the most likely side effect in this patient's case, as she does not have any history of pancreatitis or risk factors for the condition.

C. Cholelithiasis: Cholelithiasis, or gallstones, is a possible side effect of albuterol, which can cause the gallbladder to release bile into the bile ducts, leading to the formation of stones. This is the most likely side effect of the medication used to manage the patient's condition, as she has a history of watery, nonbloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps, which can be symptoms of cholelithiasis.

D. Hypoglycemia: Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is not a likely side effect of albuterol, as it is not a medication that affects blood sugar levels.

Answer: C. Cholelithiasis"
85,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 17-year-old girl visits your outpatient clinic, disclosing that she is sexually active with multiple partners and requests a prescription for oral contraceptive pills. A negative urine pregnancy test is obtained in the office. Which of the following steps is the most appropriate next action?

A. Contact the patient's parents to obtain consent
B. Recommend sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening and provide the requested prescription
C. Perform a urine drug screen
D. Advise against oral contraceptive medication use and recommend condom use instead

Answer: B. Recommend STI screening and provide the requested prescription.

Rationale: As a healthcare provider, it is important to prioritize the patient's sexual health and well-being. Given the patient's sexual activity and request for oral contraceptive pills, it is crucial to assess for potential STIs and provide appropriate screening and treatment. The patient's consent should be obtained before providing any medical interventions, including prescribing oral contraceptives."
86,"Question: A 27-year-old woman visits a psychiatrist due to feelings of sadness lasting three weeks. She was recently let go from her job, and she feels like her life is falling apart. She has difficulty sleeping and eating, and she has lost weight as a result. Despite her friends' support, she has lost interest in socializing. Her doctor prescribes an antidepressant that blocks the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine to help manage her symptoms. One week later, she is brought to the emergency room by her friends after they found her in a state of euphoria. They mention bizarre behavior, such as booking a plane ticket to New York, even though she has three interviews scheduled that week. When examined, she is unable to sit still and speaks very quickly. Which of the following was most likely prescribed by her psychiatrist?

A. Venlafaxine
B. Sertraline
C. Lithium
D. Bupropion

87,"Question: A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe, acute right leg pain that began suddenly 4 hours ago while reading the newspaper. He has a history of poorly controlled hypertension and osteoarthritis, and has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 31 years. His current medications include lisinopril, metoprolol succinate, and ibuprofen. On examination, he appears to be in severe pain and is clutching his right leg. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 102/min and irregularly irregular, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 152/94 mm Hg. The right leg is cool to the touch, with decreased femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis pulses. There is moderate weakness and decreased sensation in the right leg. An ECG shows absent P waves and a variable R-R interval. Right leg Doppler study shows inaudible arterial signal and audible venous signal. Angiography shows 90% occlusion of the right common femoral artery. In light of these findings, the most appropriate next step in management is:

A. Balloon catheter embolectomy: This is the most appropriate next step in management as the occlusion of the right common femoral artery is causing significant ischemia to the right leg, leading to acute pain, weakness, and decreased sensation. Balloon catheter embolectomy can be used to remove the occlusion and restore blood flow to the affected area.

B. Amputation of the affected limb: While amputation may be considered in severe cases of limb ischemia, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case as the patient's symptoms are acute and the occlusion is recent, making it more likely that blood flow can be restored through other means.

C. Surgical bypass of the affected vessel: While surgical bypass may be considered in cases of chronic limb ischemia, it is not necessary in this case as the occlusion is recent and can be treated with other interventions.

D. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: While percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can be used to treat occlusions in the affected vessel, it may not be effective in this case as the occlusion is severe and prolonged, and may not be able to be treated with angioplasty alone."
88,"Question: A 62-year-old man presents with a swollen and painful right knee that has been persisting for 3 days, without any history of joint disease. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals erythema and swelling of the right knee, with limited range of motion due to pain. Arthrocentesis of the right knee joint yields 7 mL of cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 29,000/mm3 (97% segmented neutrophils). Compensated polarized light microscopy of the aspirate shows...

Options:
A. Calcium pyrophosphate deposition: This is the most likely underlying mechanism of the patient's knee pain. Calcium pyrophosphate deposition is a common cause of knee pain, particularly in older adults, and is characterized by the formation of crystals in the synovial fluid. The high leukocyte count and segmented neutrophils in the aspirate suggest an inflammatory response to the crystals.
B. Mechanical stress and trauma: This option is less likely, as there is no history of trauma or mechanical stress that could have caused the knee pain.
C. Immune complex-mediated cartilage destruction: This option is also less likely, as there is no evidence of an immune-mediated response in the aspirate.
D. Monosodium urate deposition: This is the least likely underlying mechanism of the patient's knee pain. Monosodium urate deposition is a rare cause of knee pain and is typically associated with gout.

Answer: A. Calcium pyrophosphate deposition"
89,"Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician due to frequent falls, worsening muscle pain, and poor vision in low light conditions. His mother reports that he has been on a low-fat diet since infancy because of persistent diarrhea. He is at the 5th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows bilateral proximal muscle weakness and a wide ataxic gait. His serum cholesterol level is 21 mg/dL. Peripheral blood smear shows red blood cells with irregular spiny projections of varying size. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?

A. GAA trinucleotide repeats on chromosome 9
B. Post-prandial lipid-laden enterocytes
C. IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies
D. Fibrofatty replacement of muscle tissue

Answer: B. Post-prandial lipid-laden enterocytes

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of frequent falls, worsening muscle pain, and poor vision in low light conditions, along with his low height and weight percentile, suggest that he may have a metabolic disorder. The peripheral blood smear showing red blood cells with irregular spiny projections of varying size is consistent with a diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease, a group of inherited disorders characterized by the accumulation of lipids in the body. Post-prandial lipid-laden enterocytes are a hallmark of Niemann-Pick disease, and their presence in the patient's peripheral blood smear suggests that he may have this condition. Therefore, further evaluation of the patient is most likely to show the presence of post-prandial lipid-laden enterocytes."

91,"Question: A 16-year-old male presents to his pediatrician concerned about his lack of maturation and personal hygiene. His medical history includes cleft palate and asthma treated with budesonide and albuterol. He is an active gymnastics athlete and a good student. His mother is also concerned about his lack of understanding of personal hygiene, specifically forgetting to use deodorant. Upon examination, there is no evidence of enlargement of his penis or testicles, and he has no pubic or axillary hair. Which of the following sets of hormone levels is most likely to be found in this patient?

Options:

A. Decreased testosterone, decreased FSH, decreased LH, decreased GnRH - This set of hormone levels is most likely to be found in this patient, as he presents with symptoms of hypogonadism, including lack of maturation and personal hygiene. Decreased testosterone levels can lead to delayed growth and development, as well as a lack of interest in sexual activities. Decreased FSH, LH, and GnRH levels can also contribute to hypogonadism.

B. Increased testosterone, decreased FSH, decreased LH, decreased GnRH - This set of hormone levels is unlikely to be found in this patient, as he presents with symptoms of hypogonadism rather than hypergonadism. Increased testosterone levels can lead to early maturation and development, as well as an increase in sexual activity.

C. Decreased testosterone, decreased FSH, increased LH, increased GnRH - This set of hormone levels is also unlikely to be found in this patient, as he presents with symptoms of hypogonadism rather than hypergonadism. Increased LH and GnRH levels can lead to early maturation and development, as well as an increase in sexual activity.

D. Normal testosterone, normal FSH, normal LH, normal GnRH - This set of hormone levels is unlikely to be found in this patient, as he presents with symptoms of hypogonadism. Normal testosterone, FSH, LH, and GnRH levels are typically seen in individuals who are healthy and developing normally."

Question: A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician for a school physical examination. She feels well and is performing well in school, with good grades. She is 147 cm (4 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 60 kg (132 lbs), with a BMI of 27.6 kg/m2. During the examination, her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), her pulse is 82/min, her respirations are 16/min, and her blood pressure is 138/82 mm Hg in the left arm and 110/74 mm Hg in the left leg. Physical examination reveals an unusually short and broad neck with bilateral excess skin folds that extend to the shoulders and low-set ears, as well as an increased carrying angle when she fully extends her arms at her sides. An x-ray of the chest shows inferior rib notching. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be present in this patient?

Options:
A. Horseshoe adrenal gland on abdominal CT
B. Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time
C. Mutation of FBN1 on genetic testing
D. Streak ovaries on pelvic ultrasound

Answer: D. Streak ovaries on pelvic ultrasound."
93,"Question:

The scientists genetically modify B cells so they do not express the cluster of differentiation 21 (CD21) on their cell surfaces. Which of the following organisms would most likely be affected by this genetic modification?

Options:
A. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) - The CD21 protein is crucial for the attachment and entry of EBV into B cells, so the absence of CD21 on modified B cells would hinder EBV infection.
B. Measles virus - Measles virus uses CD21 as a receptor to infect B cells, so the absence of CD21 on modified B cells would reduce the susceptibility of these cells to measles virus infection.
C. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - HIV does not use CD21 as a receptor for infection, so the genetic modification of B cells to lack CD21 would not affect HIV infection.
D. Human papillomavirus - Human papillomavirus does not have a specific receptor on B cells, so the absence of CD21 on modified B cells would not affect HPV infection.

Answer: A. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)"
94,"Sure! Here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: The division chief of general internal medicine at an academic medical center is interested in reducing 30-day readmissions for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in elderly patients. Her research team decided to follow 587 patients over the age of 65 who have recently been admitted to the hospital for DKA for a 30-day period. At the end of 30 days, she identified 100 patients who were readmitted to the hospital and examined risk factors associated with readmission. The main results of her study are summarized in the table below.

RR (95% CI) P-value
Episodes of DKA in the past 3 years < 0.001
None Reference
1–2 1.23 (1.04–1.36)
3–4 1.48 (1.38–1.59)
5+ 2.20 (1.83–2.51)

Which of the following aspects of the results would support a causal relationship between a history of DKA and 30-day readmission risk for DKA?

D. Dose-response relationship

Explanation: The dose-response relationship refers to the idea that the risk of 30-day readmission for DKA increases with the number of previous episodes of DKA. In this study, the RR (relative risk) of 30-day readmission for patients with 5 or more episodes of DKA in the past 3 years is 2.20 (95% CI: 1.83–2.51), which is significantly higher than the RR for patients with 1–2 episodes (1.23, 95% CI: 1.04–1.36) or patients with no episodes (Reference). This suggests that a history of DKA is associated with an increased risk of 30-day readmission for DKA, which supports a causal relationship between the two.

A, B, and C are not correct because they do not explain the observed association between a history of DKA and 30-day readmission risk for DKA."
95,"Question: The 34-year-old woman presents to the physician due to a 4-month absence of menstruation, with previous regular 28-day cycles and moderate flow. A home pregnancy test was negative. Additionally, she experiences recurrent headaches and has difficulty seeing the edges of the screen while watching movies without turning her head. What is the likely cause of these symptoms?

Options:
A. Astrocytes - These are a type of glial cell in the central nervous system that provide support and protection to neurons. While they are not directly involved in menstruation or visual function, they play a crucial role in maintaining the health of the nervous system.
B. Adenohypophysis - Also known as the hypophysis or pituitary gland, this endocrine gland regulates various bodily functions, including menstruation. An abnormal growth or tumor in the adenohypophysis could cause hormonal imbalances that lead to irregular menstruation.
C. Schwann cells - These are specialized cells that provide insulation and support to nerve fibers in the peripheral nervous system. While they are not directly involved in menstruation or visual function, they play a crucial role in maintaining the health of the nervous system.
D. Pineal gland - This endocrine gland located in the brain produces melatonin, a hormone involved in regulating sleep-wake cycles. While it is not directly involved in menstruation or visual function, it can affect hormonal balances that may contribute to irregular menstruation.

Answer: B. Adenohypophysis"
96,"Question: A 67-year-old man presents to his family physician's office for a routine visit and to discuss a growth on his toenail that has been gradually enlarging for a month. He has a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension and is on metformin, atorvastatin, and lisinopril. He admits to smoking 2 packs of cigarettes daily for the past 45 years. His blood pressure reading today is 132/88 mm Hg, heart rate is 78/min, respiration rate is 12/min and his temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F). On exam, the patient appears alert and in no apparent distress. Capillary refill is 3 seconds. Diminished dull and sharp sensations are present bilaterally in the lower extremities distal to the mid-tibial region. An image of the patient's toenail is provided. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of a nail clipping sample confirms the presence of hyphae. Which of the following treatment options will be most effective for this condition?

A. Terbinafine: This is the most effective treatment option for the condition. Terbinafine is an antifungal medication that is commonly used to treat fungal infections of the nails, including onychomycosis. It works by inhibiting the growth of fungal cells and promoting nail growth.

B. Betamethasone + vitamin D analog: This treatment option is not the most effective for this condition. Betamethasone is a steroid medication that is used to reduce inflammation, but it is not effective against fungal infections. Vitamin D analog is a medication that is used to treat vitamin D deficiency, but it is not relevant to the treatment of fungal infections.

C. Fluconazole: This treatment option is not the most effective for this condition. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that is used to treat fungal infections, but it is not effective against fungal infections of the nails.

D. Griseofulvin: This treatment option is not the most effective for this condition. Griseofulvin is an antifungal medication that is used to treat fungal infections of the skin, but it is not effective against fungal infections of the nails.

Answer: A. Terbinafine"
97,"Question: A 64-year-old female presents to her primary care physician for an annual checkup. She states that her health is adequate, but she has not been doing well since her husband died last year. She is able to get by but admits to having trouble caring for herself, cooking, cleaning, and paying her bills. The patient complains of diffuse muscle aches and pains. She has a past medical history of anxiety and seasonal affective disorder. She is not currently taking any medications. On physical exam, you note a gaunt woman with a depressed affect. You note that her body mass index (BMI) and height have both decreased since her last annual visit. On physical exam, her cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal exams are within normal limits. Lab work is drawn and is as follows:

Serum:
Na+: 135 mEq/L
K+: 3.7 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
HCO3-: 23 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen: 7 mg/dL
Glucose: 70 mg/dL
Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
Ca2+: 8.0 mg/dL
Mg2+: 1.5 mEq/L
Parathyroid hormone: 855 pg/mL
Alkaline phosphatase: 135 U/L
Phosphorus: 2.6 mg/dL

Hemoglobin: 14 g/dL
Hematocrit: 36%
Platelet count: 187,000/mm^3
Leukocyte count: 4,700/mm^3

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Osteopenia
B. Osteoporosis
C. Osteomalacia
D. Hyperparathyroidism

Answer: C. Osteomalacia

Rationale: The patient's low serum calcium level (8.0 mg/dL) and high parathyroid hormone level (855 pg/mL) are consistent with osteomalacia, a condition characterized by softening of the bones due to vitamin D deficiency or other causes. The patient's symptoms of muscle aches and pains, decreased BMI and height, and depressed affect are also consistent with osteomalacia. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are conditions characterized by low bone density, but they do not typically present with muscle aches and pains. Hyperparathyroidism is a condition where the parathyroid glands produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone, leading to high serum calcium levels and is not the most likely diagnosis in this case."
98,"Question: A 31-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder presents to the physician with a month-long history of erectile dysfunction (ED). He experiences difficulty maintaining an erection during intercourse and rarely awakens with an erection. Despite feeling happy in his current relationship, he reports decreased sexual desire and embarrassment about his sexual performance. The patient sustained a lumbar vertebral injury one year ago following a motor vehicle accident. On physical examination, testicular atrophy is observed, along with otherwise normal genitalia. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's ED symptoms?

Options:

A. Decreased testosterone levels: Testosterone is a key hormone involved in male sexual function, including erectile function. Given the patient's history of bipolar disorder and the recent lumbar vertebral injury, it is possible that his decreased testosterone levels are contributing to his ED symptoms.

B. Peyronie disease: Peyronie disease is a condition characterized by the development of scar tissue in the penis, leading to erectile dysfunction. Although the patient's physical examination does not reveal any obvious signs of Peyronie disease, it is still a possibility to consider given the patient's history of ED.

C. Microvascular disease: Microvascular disease refers to the narrowing or blockage of the small blood vessels that supply the penis, leading to erectile dysfunction. Given the patient's history of ED and the recent lumbar vertebral injury, it is possible that microvascular disease is the underlying cause of his symptoms.

D. Psychologic stressors: Psychologic stressors, such as embarrassment or shame related to sexual performance, can also contribute to ED. Although the patient reports feeling embarrassed about his sexual performance, it is difficult to determine the extent to which this is contributing to his ED symptoms without further evaluation.

Answer: A. Decreased testosterone levels"
99,"Question: A 28-year-old man presents to the emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain and nausea for the past 5 hours. The pain started with a dull ache but is now quite severe. He notes that he “just doesn’t feel like eating” and has not eaten anything for almost a day. Although the nausea is getting worse, the patient has not vomited. He notes no medical issues in the past and is not currently taking any medications. He admits to drinking alcohol (at least 2–3 bottles of beer per day after work and frequent binge-drinking weekends with friends). He says that he does not smoke or use illicit drugs. Vital signs include: pulse rate 120/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. On examination, the patient’s abdomen is diffusely tender. His breath smells like alcohol, with a fruity tinge to it. Bowel sounds are present. No other findings are noted. Fingerstick glucose is 76mg/dL. After the examination, the patient suddenly and spontaneously vomits. Which of the following is the underlying mechanism of the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

A. Increased acetyl CoA levels: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are consistent with a condition known as alcohol-related delirium tremens (DTs). Alcohol can increase the production of acetyl CoA, a molecule involved in the metabolism of alcohol, leading to an accumulation of ketones in the body. This can cause a range of symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Therefore, option A is the most likely diagnosis in this patient.

B. Inadequate insulin production: While alcohol can affect insulin production and lead to hyperglycemia, the patient's blood glucose level of 76mg/dL is not particularly high, and it is unlikely to be the primary cause of their symptoms.

C. Increased osmolal gap: An increased osmolal gap can occur in alcohol-related dehydration, but the patient's breath smells like alcohol and they have vomited, which suggests that dehydration is unlikely to be the primary cause of their symptoms.

D. Thiamine deficiency: Thiamine deficiency can occur in alcoholics due to the interference of alcohol with thiamine absorption. However, the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea are more consistent with DTs than thiamine deficiency.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Increased acetyl CoA levels."
100,"Question: An 18-year-old female presents to the clinic complaining of acute abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) for the past couple of hours. The pain is concentrated at the RLQ with no clear precipitating factor and worsens with movement. Acetaminophen provides some relief but the patient is concerned as the pain has occurred monthly for the past 3 months. She denies any headache, chest pain, weight changes, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, fever, or sexual activity. The patient reports a regular menstruation cycle with her last period being 2 weeks ago. A physical examination reveals a tender RLQ to palpation with a negative psoas sign. A urine beta-hCG test is negative. An ultrasound of the abdomen is unremarkable. What is the primary hormone responsible for the patient's symptoms?

A. Progesterone synthesized through the activation of cholesterol desmolase
B. 17-beta-estradiol synthesized through the activation of aromatase
C. Inhibition of the anterior pituitary to decrease secretion of FSH and LH
D. Inhibition of the hypothalamus to decrease secretion of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)

Answer: A. Progesterone synthesized through the activation of cholesterol desmolase

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute abdominal pain in the RLQ, occurring monthly, are consistent with the onset of ovulation and the release of progesterone from the ovaries. Progesterone is synthesized through the activation of cholesterol desmolase, which is increased during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Therefore, the main function of the hormone responsible for the patient's symptoms is to increase the activity of cholesterol desmolase to synthesize progesterone."
101,"Question: A 9-month-old infant is brought to the pediatrician for immunizations and assessment. His parents report that he is eating well and produces several wet diapers every day. He is a happy and curious child. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. The infant's vital signs are normal. Physical growth is appropriate for his age. The physician notes a loud holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border (grade IV) and orders an echocardiogram which confirms the diagnosis of congenital heart defect. Based on echocardiogram findings, the pediatrician reassures the parents that the infant will be monitored, but most likely will not require surgical intervention. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Atrial septal defect: This is a type of congenital heart defect that occurs when there is a hole in the wall between the atria (the upper chambers of the heart). While it is possible that the infant may have an atrial septal defect, the echocardiogram findings suggest that the murmur is located at the left sternal border, which is more consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD).

B. Ventricular septal defect: A VSD is a type of congenital heart defect that occurs when there is a hole in the wall between the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart). The echocardiogram findings confirm the diagnosis of VSD, which is the most likely diagnosis based on the location of the murmur.

C. Tetralogy of Fallot: This is a rare congenital heart defect that involves four abnormalities of the heart, including a VSD, pulmonary stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve), right ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement of the right ventricle), and a patent ductus arteriosus (a persistent connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery). While tetralogy of Fallot is a possible diagnosis, the echocardiogram findings do not support this diagnosis, as there is no evidence of pulmonary stenosis or right ventricular hypertrophy.

D. Patent ductus arteriosus: This is a congenital heart defect that occurs when the ductus arteriosus (a blood vessel that connects the aorta and the pulmonary artery in the fetus) does not close after birth. While patent ductus arteriosus is a possible diagnosis, the echocardiogram findings do not support this diagnosis, as there is no evidence of a persistent connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery.

Answer: B. Ventricular septal defect"
102,"Question: A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 14 weeks' gestation, presents to the physician with a 3-day history of abnormal vaginal discharge. She has not experienced fever, chills, or abdominal pain. One week ago, her 2-year-old daughter had a urinary tract infection that resolved with antibiotic therapy. The patient reports being sexually active with one male partner, and they do not use condoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows an inflamed and friable cervix with mucopurulent, foul-smelling discharge from the cervical os. There is no uterine or cervical motion tenderness. Vaginal pH measurement shows a pH of 3.5. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?

A. Wet mount preparation: A wet mount preparation can help identify the presence of bacteria, yeast, or trichomonads in the vaginal discharge. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with a bacterial infection, and the wet mount may not provide additional diagnostic information. Therefore, this option is not the most appropriate initial step in management.

B. Amine test: The amine test can help identify the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV), which is a common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge in pregnant women. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are also consistent with a bacterial infection, and the amine test may not provide additional diagnostic information.

C. Urine analysis and culture: A urine culture can help identify the presence of bacterial pathogens in the urinary tract, which could be causing the patient's symptoms. However, the patient's history of a recent urinary tract infection and the absence of urethral discharge suggest that the infection is likely confined to the vagina. A urine culture may not provide additional diagnostic information in this case.

D. Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT): A NAAT is a highly sensitive and specific test that can detect the presence of bacterial pathogens in the vagina, including BV. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a bacterial infection, and a NAAT may provide the most accurate diagnosis. Therefore, this option is the most appropriate initial step in management.

Answer: D. Nucleic acid amplification test."
103,"Question: A 48-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her family at her psychiatrist's recommendation due to increased restlessness and racing thoughts. The patient has a past medical history of bipolar disorder on lithium and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The family and patient both report that she has been taking her medications, and she denies any recent illness or sick contacts. Her vital signs are within normal limits, except for a temperature of 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, pulse of 130/min, and respirations of 20/min, with diaphoresis and an irregularly irregular rhythm with a 2/6 early systolic murmur on cardiac exam. The blood counts and metabolic panel are within normal limits, and her lithium level is within therapeutic range. Which of the following laboratory tests would be the most useful in evaluating this patient?

A. Thyroglobulin level: This test measures the level of thyroglobulin, a protein produced by the thyroid gland, in the blood. While thyroglobulin can be elevated in some thyroid disorders, it is not particularly useful in evaluating patients with bipolar disorder or type 1 diabetes mellitus.

B. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels: TSH is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). TSH and FT4 levels can help evaluate thyroid function and detect abnormalities such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In this patient, evaluating TSH and FT4 levels could help determine if there are any thyroid-related issues contributing to her symptoms.

C. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and total thyroxine (FT4 + FT3) levels: This test measures the combined levels of T4 and T3 in the blood, which can help evaluate thyroid function more comprehensively than measuring T4 alone.

D. Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels: These tests measure the levels of T3 and T4 in the blood, which can help evaluate thyroid function and detect abnormalities such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.

Answer: B. Thyroid stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels."
104,"Question: A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for anticoagulation following a pulmonary embolism. She was found to have a deep venous thrombosis on further workup after a long plane ride coming back from visiting China. She denies any personal history of blood clots in her past, but she says that her mother has also had to be treated for pulmonary embolism in the recent past. Her past medical history is significant for preeclampsia, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and she currently denies any illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding and complexion is pale, but breath sounds remain clear. Oxygen saturation was initially 81% on room air, with a new oxygen requirement of 8 L by face mask. On day 6 of combined heparin and warfarin anticoagulation, her platelet count decreases from 182,000/mcL to 63,000/mcL. Her international normalized ratio (INR) is not yet therapeutic. What is the next best step in therapy?

A) Continue heparin and warfarin until INR is therapeutic for 24 hours - This option is incorrect because the patient's platelet count has decreased significantly on day 6 of anticoagulation, indicating that the current regimen is not effective in preventing further blood clotting.

B) Discontinue heparin; continue warfarin - This option is the correct answer. The patient's platelet count has decreased significantly, indicating that the combination of heparin and warfarin is not effective in preventing further blood clotting. Discontinuing heparin and continuing warfarin may help to improve the patient's INR and prevent further blood clotting.

C) Discontinue heparin and warfarin - This option is incorrect because discontinuing both heparin and warfarin may lead to a risk of further blood clotting and pulmonary embolism.

D) Continue heparin and warfarin, and administer vitamin K - This option is incorrect because vitamin K is not a recommended treatment for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

Therefore, the next best step in therapy is to discontinue heparin and continue warfarin."
105,"Question: A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe left leg pain accompanied by numbness and weakness. His medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His vital signs are: blood pressure 155/92 mm Hg, temperature 37.1°C (98.7°F), and irregular pulse of 92/min. Physical examination reveals absent left popliteal and posterior tibial pulses. His left leg is noticeably cold and pale. There is no significant tissue compromise, nerve damage, or sensory loss. Which of the following will most likely be required for this patient's condition?

A. Thromboembolectomy: Given the patient's symptoms of sudden onset of severe pain, numbness, and weakness in the left leg, along with the absence of pulse in the left popliteal and posterior tibial areas, it is likely that the patient is experiencing a limb threatening condition such as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Thromboembolectomy is the surgical removal of a blood clot that has formed in a blood vessel, and it is the most appropriate intervention for this patient's condition.

B. Fasciotomy: Fasciotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting the fascia, a layer of tissue that surrounds muscles and organs, to relieve compression and swelling. While this procedure may be necessary in some cases of compartment syndrome, which is a condition where the muscles and tissues in a compartment of the body swell and become compressed, it is not the most likely intervention for this patient's condition.

C. Warfarin: Warfarin is an anticoagulant medication that is used to prevent blood clots from forming. While it may be prescribed to prevent DVTs in some cases, it is not the most appropriate medication for this patient's condition.

D. Antibiotics: Antibiotics are medications that are used to treat bacterial infections. While they may be prescribed to prevent infection in some cases, they are not the most likely intervention for this patient's condition.

Answer: A. Thromboembolectomy"
106,"Question: A 2500-g (5-lb 8-oz) female newborn delivered at 37 weeks' gestation develops rapid breathing, grunting, and subcostal retractions shortly after birth. Despite appropriate lifesaving measures, the newborn dies 2 hours later. Autopsy shows bilateral renal agenesis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this newborn's respiratory distress?

Options:

A. Decreased amniotic fluid ingestion: This option is unlikely to be the cause of the newborn's respiratory distress. Decreased amniotic fluid ingestion can lead to respiratory distress in newborns, but it is not the most likely cause in this case, as the newborn was delivered at 37 weeks' gestation, which is considered full-term.

B. Injury to the diaphragmatic innervation: This option is unlikely to be the cause of the newborn's respiratory distress. While injury to the diaphragmatic innervation can cause respiratory distress in newborns, it is not the most likely cause in this case, as there is no history of trauma or injury to the newborn.

C. Collapse of the supraglottic airway: This option is the most likely underlying cause of the newborn's respiratory distress. Collapse of the supraglottic airway can occur in newborns due to various factors, including prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome, and congenital anomalies. In this case, the autopsy finding of bilateral renal agenesis suggests that the cause of the respiratory distress may be related to the newborn's underlying genetic disorder.

D. Surfactant inactivation and epithelial inflammation: This option is unlikely to be the cause of the newborn's respiratory distress. Surfactant inactivation and epithelial inflammation can cause respiratory distress in newborns, but it is not the most likely cause in this case, as the newborn was delivered at 37 weeks' gestation and did not have any other risk factors for respiratory distress.

Answer: C. Collapse of the supraglottic airway."
107,"Question: A 49-year-old woman presents with a mass in her left breast, which she discovered during a monthly self-examination 3 months ago. She believes the mass has enlarged since then. The patient denies any symptoms such as ulceration, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, or nipple discharge. Her past medical history includes mild osteoporosis managed with alendronate. On physical examination, a 4-mm-diameter left breast mass is firm and non-tender on palpation. A mammogram of the left breast is normal, but the mass cannot be visualized. What is the best next step in the management of this patient?

A. Begin tamoxifen therapy: Tamoxifen is a hormone therapy that is commonly used to treat breast cancer, but it is not the best option for this patient given the absence of symptoms and the normal mammogram result.

B. Repeat a mammogram in 6 months: While a repeat mammogram may help to better visualize the mass, it is not a necessary step at this time, given the normal result of the initial mammogram.

C. Observe for 6 months and biopsy the mass if it persists: A biopsy is the best option to determine the nature of the mass, as it has persisted for more than 3 months and the patient is symptomatic.

D. Perform an ultrasound of the left breast: An ultrasound can help to better evaluate the mass and determine its size, location, and characteristics. It may be useful in guiding a biopsy if one is deemed necessary.

Answer: D. Perform an ultrasound of the left breast."
108,"Question: A 62-year-old male is rushed to the emergency department (ED) for what he believes is his second myocardial infarction (MI). His medical history is significant for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a prior MI at the age of 58. After receiving aspirin, morphine, and face mask oxygen in the field, the patient arrives to the ED tachycardic (105 bpm), diaphoretic, and normotensive (126/86). A 12 lead electrocardiogram shows ST-elevation in I, aVL, and V5-V6. The attending physician suspects a lateral wall infarction. Which of following beta-blockers should be given to this patient and why?

Options:

A. Propranolol, because it is a non-selective β-blocker
B. Metoprolol, because it is a selective β1 > β2 blocker
C. Atenolol, because it is a selective β2 > β1 blocker
D. Labetalol, because it is a selective β1 > β2 blocker

Answer: B. Metoprolol, because it is a selective β1 > β2 blocker

Rationale: In this scenario, the patient is presenting with a lateral wall infarction, which is associated with ST-elevation in leads I, aVL, and V5-V6. As a selective β1 > β2 blocker, Metoprolol will preferentially block the β1 receptors in the heart, which are more densely expressed in the left ventricle and can help to slow the heart rate, reduce the contractility of the heart, and reduce the oxygen demand of the myocardium. This will help to reduce the damage to the myocardium and improve the patient's outcomes. Propranolol, Atenolol, and Labetalol are non-selective β-blockers that can block both β1 and β2 receptors, and may not be as effective in this particular situation."
109,"Question: A 54-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a severe diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient states that the pain started acutely 3 hours ago and has not improved. He denies any fever or chills. His last bowel movement was yesterday morning, which was normal. The patient has a history of hypertension and infectious endocarditis 7 years ago. Current medications are hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril. Patient denies any history of gastrointestinal disease, although notes he frequently has abdominal discomfort after meals. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature of 37.4℃ (99.3℉). On physical examination, the patient is agitated and appears to be in significant pain. Lungs are clear to auscultation. The cardiac exam is significant for a 2/6 pansystolic grade murmur best heard at the apex and the presence of a pulse deficit. The abdomen is soft and nondistended, but there is tenderness to palpation in the periumbilical region. No rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are present. Laboratory tests show the following results: RBC count 4.4 x 106/mm3, Hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL, Hematocrit 35%, Leukocyte count 12,400/mm3, Platelet count 312,000/mm3, Serum: Na+ 140 mEq/L, Cl- 103 mEq/L, K+ 4.4 mEq/L, HCO3 20 mEq/L, Base deficit -4, BUN 11 mg/dL, Glucose 97 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, Ca2+ 10.7 mg/dL, Lactate 7.6 mmol/L, Amylase 240 U/L, Stool guaiac negative, EKG is significant for findings consistent with atrial fibrillation and left ventricular hypertrophy. Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen on this patient's contrast CT of the abdomen?

Answer: C. Lack of enhancement of the branches of the superior mesenteric artery.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with the physical examination findings of tenderness in the periumbilical region, are consistent with a bowel obstruction or bowel perforation. The lack of enhancement of the branches of the superior mesenteric artery on CT scan suggests a bowel obstruction, as the bowel will not be able to absorb contrast material due to the obstruction. This is more likely than the other options, which are less consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings."
110,"Question: A 31-year-old male traveler in Thailand experiences recurring fever, headache, and excessive sweating every 48 hours. Upon peripheral blood smear examination, Plasmodia infection is confirmed with the presence of trophozoites and schizonts. The patient is treated with chloroquine and primaquine. Primaquine targets which of the following Plasmodia forms:

A. Trophozoite: The trophozoite is the merozoite stage of the Plasmodia parasite that is responsible for the symptoms of malaria. Primaquine targets and kills the trophozoites, preventing them from further multiplying and causing disease. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

B. Schizont: The schizont is a stage of the Plasmodia parasite that exists within the host's red blood cells. It is responsible for the production of merozoites, which are the infective stage of the parasite that can be transmitted to other mosquitoes or humans. Primaquine does not target schizonts directly, so option B is incorrect.

C. Sporozoite: The sporozoite is the infective stage of the Plasmodia parasite that is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Since the patient is already experiencing symptoms of malaria, it is unlikely that they were infected through a recent mosquito bite. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

D. Hypnozoite: The hypnozoite is a dormant form of the Plasmodia parasite that can survive within the host's liver and brain tissues. It can reactivate and cause malaria symptoms months or even years after the initial infection. Primaquine is effective against hypnozoites, so option D is correct.

Answer: D. Hypnozoite"
111,"Question: A previously healthy 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of progressive rash. The rash started on his face and now involves the entire body. For the past week, he has had a cough and a runny nose. He is visiting from the Philippines with his family. He is in first grade and spends his afternoons at an after-school child care program. Immunization records are not available. His temperature is 39.5°C (103°F), pulse is 115/min, and blood pressure is 105/66 mm Hg. Examination shows generalized lymphadenopathy. There is an erythematous maculopapular, blanching, and partially confluent exanthem on his entire body. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?

A. Rapid plasma reagin: This test is used to detect antibodies against the measles virus in the blood, but it may not be able to confirm the diagnosis in the early stages of the illness.

B. Tzanck smear: This test involves examining a skin scraping under a microscope for signs of the measles virus, but it may not be able to detect the virus in the early stages of the illness.

C. Measles-specific IgM antibodies: This test detects the presence of antibodies against the measles virus in the blood, which can confirm the diagnosis of measles.

D. Rapid antigen detection testing: This test detects the measles virus in a patient's nasopharyngeal secretions, which can confirm the diagnosis of measles.

Answer: C. Measles-specific IgM antibodies."
112,"Question: A 19-year-old Caucasian college student is home for the summer. Her parents notice that she has lost a significant amount of weight. The daughter explains that the weight loss was unintentional and also experiences increased thirst, hunger, and urine production. Her parents decide to take her to their family physician, who suspects the presence of which of the following conditions?

Options:
A. Evidence of amyloid deposition in pancreatic islets
B. Elevated ketone levels
C. Hypoglycemia
D. Hyperinsulinemia

Answer: B. Elevated ketone levels"
113,"Question: A 7-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother 1 hour after falling off his bike and landing head-first on the pavement. His mother reports that he did not lose consciousness but has been agitated and complaining of a headache since the incident. He has no prior medical history and takes no medications. His vital signs are: temperature 37.1°C (98.7°F), pulse 115/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 100/65 mm Hg. A large bruise is observed on the anterior scalp. Following examination, no other abnormalities are found. A non-contrast CT scan of the head reveals a non-depressed linear skull fracture with a 2-mm separation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Inpatient observation
B. Discharge home
C. MRI of the brain
D. CT angiography

Answer: A. Inpatient observation

Rationale: Given the child's recent head injury, it is crucial to closely monitor him for any changes in his neurological status or signs of elevated intracranial pressure. Inpatient observation allows for continuous monitoring and prompt intervention if necessary. While a CT angiography may provide additional information on the extent of the skull fracture, it may not be necessary in this scenario, especially given the child's relatively mild symptoms and lack of any other neurological findings. An MRI of the brain may also be unnecessary at this time, as it may not provide any additional information that would alter management. Discharging the child home without proper observation may increase the risk of complications, such as worsening of the head injury or development of a cerebral hemorrhage."
114,"Question: A 65-year-old male presents with a 10-month history of crampy lower extremity pain in the left leg, exacerbated by walking and relieved by rest. The pain is particularly severe when walking on an incline. He has a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. His blood pressure is 140/92 mmHg. On physical examination, dry and hairless skin is noted over the left foot. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. Thrombosing vasculitis of the popliteal artery
B. Intimal plaque in the posterior tibial artery
C. Fibrin clot in the left popliteal vein
D. Systemic hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis

Answer: B. Intimal plaque in the posterior tibial artery.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of crampy lower extremity pain, exacerbated by walking and relieved by rest, are consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD) caused by intimal plaque in the posterior tibial artery. The patient's history of smoking and hypertension increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Thrombosing vasculitis of the popliteal artery is less likely, as it is a rare condition that typically presents with more sudden onset of symptoms. Fibrin clot in the left popliteal vein is also less likely, as it would cause swelling rather than cramping in the affected limb. Systemic hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis is a rare and complex condition that is not typically associated with cramping pain in the lower extremities."
115,"Question: A 7-year-old boy presents with right hip pain for the past 2 days. He reports gradual onset of pain and states it hurts to walk. He had a recent cold last week but is otherwise healthy. His temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 107/70 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, respiratory rate is 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals no swelling or warmth surrounding the joint. The patient is sitting with the right hip flexed, abducted, and externally rotated. Passive range of motion of the hip causes discomfort. The patient is able to ambulate but states it hurts. An initial radiograph of the hip is unremarkable. The patient's CRP is 0.10 mg/L. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

A. Arthrocentesis

B. Ibuprofen

C. MRI

D. Prednisone

Answer: B. Ibuprofen

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of right hip pain and discomfort with ambulation suggest the possibility of a musculoskeletal condition such as a strain or sprain. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help manage pain and reduce inflammation. It is the best option for managing the patient's symptoms in the initial stages of evaluation.

Arthrocentesis, or joint aspiration, is a diagnostic procedure that involves removing fluid from the joint to evaluate for inflammation or infection. However, in this case, the patient's initial radiograph is unremarkable, and the CRP level is normal, which suggests that there is no evidence of infection or significant inflammation. Therefore, arthrocentesis is not the best next step in management.

MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, is a diagnostic test that can help evaluate the soft tissues of the body, including muscles, tendons, and ligaments. However, MRI is not necessary in the initial evaluation of this patient, as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a musculoskeletal condition that can be managed with conservative treatment.

Prednisone is a steroid medication that can help reduce inflammation, but it is not the best option for managing this patient's symptoms in the initial stages of evaluation. Prednisone is typically reserved for more severe conditions that require systemic corticosteroid therapy, such as infections or autoimmune disorders.

Therefore, the best next step in management of this patient is to prescribe ibuprofen for pain and inflammation management."
116,"Question: A 26-year-old G1P0 woman visits her maternal and fetal medicine specialist at 15 weeks of gestation due to concerns about fetal developmental abnormalities, given her family history of congenital disorders affecting mobility. Amniocentesis results show normal levels of all serum proteins and circulating factors, but the physician still cautions that there is a possibility of a neural tube defect. If this child were born with a neural tube defect, what would be the most likely finding?

A. Absence of the brain and skull
B. Bulging of the meninges through a bony defect
C. Protrusion of the meninges and spinal cord through a bony defect
D. A small patch of hair or skin dimple on the lower back

Answer: D. A small patch of hair or skin dimple on the lower back."
117,"Question: A 50-year-old woman, gravida 5, para 5, presents to the physician with a complaint of decreased sexual desire for the past 6 months. She has been sexually active with her husband but no longer has the desire to engage in sexual intercourse. She feels guilty and worried about losing her husband if this problem persists. Additionally, they have been experiencing financial difficulties, and she has been having trouble sleeping and waking up frequently, feeling tired throughout the day. One year ago, the patient underwent a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to uterine prolapse. Her last menstrual period was 2 years ago. The patient does not smoke and drinks 3-4 glasses of wine daily. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities except for an enlarged liver. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's loss of libido?

A. Chronic alcohol consumption
B. Major depressive disorder
C. Decreased testosterone levels
D. Elevated prolactin levels

Answer: C. Decreased testosterone levels.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of decreased sexual desire and fatigue are consistent with hypogonadism, which can be caused by decreased testosterone levels. The patient's history of hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, as well as her age, also suggest that hypogonadism is a likely cause. While chronic alcohol consumption, major depressive disorder, and elevated prolactin levels can also cause decreased libido, they are less likely to be the primary cause in this patient's case."
118,"Question: A 24-year-old man is rushed to your emergency department by the local police, showing signs of acute psychological distress. Upon interviewing the patient, you learn that he has not slept in two days and is experiencing auditory hallucinations. He also reports feeling agitated and paranoid, but his mood is within the normal range. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Schizophrenia
B. Schizotypal disorder
C. Schizoaffective disorder
D. Bipolar disorder

Answer: C. Schizoaffective disorder.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of auditory hallucinations, agitation, and paranoia, along with his lack of sleep and normal mood, are consistent with schizoaffective disorder. This disorder is characterized by a combination of symptoms of both schizophrenia (positive symptoms) and a mood disorder (negative symptoms), which is what the patient is experiencing. Schizotypal disorder and schizophrenia are also possibilities, but the patient's history of previous hospitalization for auditory hallucinations and the presence of mood symptoms argue in favor of schizoaffective disorder. Bipolar disorder is not the most likely diagnosis, as the patient does not meet the criteria for mania or hypomania."
119,"Question: A 27-year-old young man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of weakness and tingling in his hand. The patient is an avid bodybuilder and has noticed gradual worsening of grip strength in both hands, especially after long workouts. The patient has a history of anabolic steroid use in high school. On examination, the patient has loss of sensation over the volar surface of the 4th and 5th digits and medial forearm, with 3/5 grip strength in the left hand and 2/5 grip strength in the right hand. There is also weakness in finger adduction and abduction. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Cubital tunnel compression
B. Guyon's canal compression
C. Carpal tunnel syndrome
D. Posterior interosseous nerve compression

Answer: A. Cubital tunnel compression.

The patient's symptoms of weakness and tingling in the hand, particularly in the distribution of the ulnar nerve, are consistent with cubital tunnel compression. The patient's history of anabolic steroid use may also contribute to the development of cubital tunnel syndrome, as steroid use can lead to swelling of the retrohumeral tissue and compression of the ulnar nerve. The patient's grip strength and muscle weakness also support this diagnosis."
120,"Question: A 45-year-old woman presents to her physician with a 4-month history of irritability and frequent bowel movements, accompanied by a 6.8-kg (15-lb) unintentional weight loss. She has not experienced any changes in appetite or diet. Her temperature is 37.4°C (99.4°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg. On examination, her thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged without any palpable nodules, and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration is 0.2 μU/mL, thyroxine (T4) concentration is 22 μg/dL, and antibodies against the TSH receptor are detected. Which of the following treatment options is likely to have the lowest recurrence rate for this patient's condition?

A. Subtotal thyroidectomy: This surgical procedure involves removing a portion of the thyroid gland, but leaving enough tissue to maintain normal thyroid function. While it can provide relief from symptoms, the recurrence rate for this procedure can be relatively high, ranging from 10% to 30%.

B. Radioactive iodine ablation: This treatment involves taking a small dose of radioactive iodine, which is absorbed by the remaining thyroid tissue, destroying it and reducing the production of thyroid hormones. This modality has a lower recurrence rate compared to subtotal thyroidectomy, ranging from 5% to 15%.

C. Propranolol: This medication is a beta-blocker that can be used to treat hyperthyroidism by blocking the effects of excess thyroid hormones on the body. However, it is not a curative treatment and may not be effective in reducing symptoms in the long term.

D. Methimazole: This medication is an antithyroid drug that can reduce the production of thyroid hormones by the remaining thyroid tissue. While it can provide relief from symptoms, it may not be as effective in reducing the size of the thyroid gland as other treatments, and the recurrence rate can be relatively high, ranging from 10% to 30%.

Answer: B. Radioactive iodine ablation"
121,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 54-year-old man presents to his physician with a 4-month history of progressively worsening diarrhea, with 4-6 episodes per day, and fatigue, weight loss of 5 kg (11 lbs), and pale appearance. He recently returned from Bangladesh after a year-long business trip and has a history of osteoarthritis and hypertension. His current medications include amlodipine and naproxen. On examination, he has pale conjunctivae and dry mucous membranes, angular stomatitis, and glossitis. The abdomen is distended but soft and nontender, and rectal examination reveals no abnormalities. Laboratory tests show hemoglobin 8.9 g/dL, leukocyte count 4100/mm3, platelet count 160,000/mm3, mean corpuscular volume 110 μm3, serum sodium 133 mEq/L, chloride 98 mEq/L, potassium 3.3 mEq/L, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, and IgA 250 mg/dL, with negative anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA. Stool cultures and tests for ova and parasites are negative, and fecal fat content is 22 g/day (<7). Fecal lactoferrin is negative, and elastase is within normal limits. Which of the following diagnostic procedures is the most appropriate next step?

A. CT scan of the abdomen
B. Schilling test
C. Enteroscopy
D. PAS-stained biopsy of small bowel

Answer: C. Enteroscopy"
122,"Question: A worried mother brings her 12-day-old son to the emergency room, concerned that his body is turning ""yellow"". What is the next best treatment in this scenario?

Options:

A. Phenobarbitol
B. Phototherapy
C. Exchange transfusion
D. Reassure mother that jaundice will remit, advise her to continue breastfeeding

Answer: D. Reassure mother that jaundice will remit, advise her to continue breastfeeding

Explanation:

In this scenario, the patient is a healthy 12-day-old neonate with a jaundiced face and chest, with an indirect bilirubin level of 10 mg/dL and total bilirubin level of 11 mg/dL. While these levels are elevated, they are within the normal range for newborns. The mother's concerns are unwarranted, and the next best course of action is to reassure her that jaundice is a common and normal condition in newborns, and that it will resolve on its own within a few days to a week. Breastfeeding is also important to continue, as it provides optimal nutrition and helps to reduce the risk of jaundice.

Phenobarbitol is not a recommended treatment for jaundice in newborns, as it can have serious side effects and is not effective in reducing bilirubin levels. Phototherapy may be considered in more severe cases of jaundice, but in this scenario, it is not necessary. Exchange transfusion is only considered in severe cases of jaundice where the bilirubin level is above 20 mg/dL, and in this case, it is not necessary."
123,"Question: A 9-year-old girl presents with a 3-week history of cough. Her mother reports that initially, she had a runny nose and was tired, with a slight cough, but as the runny nose resolved, the cough seemed to get worse. She further states that the cough is dry sounding and occurs during the day and night. She describes having coughing spasms that occasionally end in vomiting, but between episodes of coughing she is fine. She reports that during a coughing spasm, her daughter will gasp for air and sometimes make a “whooping” noise. A nasopharyngeal swab confirms a diagnosis of Bordetella pertussis. Which of the following statements apply to this patient?

B. :[option B]
C. :[option C]
D. :[option D].

Here are the options for this question:

A. Her 3-month-old brother should be treated with azithromycin as prophylaxis.
B. Her classmates should be treated with clarithromycin as prophylaxis.
C. She will have lifelong natural immunity against Bordetella pertussis.
D. Her classmates should receive a TdaP booster regardless of their vaccination status.

Answer: A. Her 3-month-old brother should be treated with azithromycin as prophylaxis.

Explanation: The 9-year-old girl has been diagnosed with Bordetella pertussis, and it is important to prevent the spread of the infection to her 3-month-old brother, who is too young to receive the vaccine. Azithromycin is an effective antibiotic for prophylaxis against Bordetella pertussis, and it is recommended to treat close contacts of a person with pertussis, including siblings, with azithromycin for 21 days to prevent the spread of the infection."
124,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 40-year-old man presents to the physician with a 1-month history of a painless lump on his neck. Two years ago, he underwent surgery for treatment-resistant hypertension, episodic headaches, and palpitations. Upon physical examination, a firm, irregular swelling is noted on the right side of the neck. An ultrasonography of the thyroid gland reveals a 2-cm nodule with irregular margins and microcalcifications in the right thyroid lobe. Which of the following substances is likely to have increased levels in the patient's bloodwork?

A. Calcitonin: Calcitonin is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland that helps regulate calcium metabolism. Its levels may be elevated in cases of thyroid nodules or cancer.
B. Gastrin: Gastrin is a hormone produced by the stomach that stimulates the production of stomach acid. Its levels may be elevated in cases of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which can cause hypertension, headaches, and palpitations.
C. Metanephrines: Metanephrines are hormones produced by the adrenal glands that help regulate blood pressure and heart rate. Their levels may be elevated in cases of pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that can cause hypertension and other symptoms.
D. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): TSH is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that regulates the activity of the thyroid gland. Its levels may be elevated in cases of hypothyroidism, an underactive thyroid gland that can cause fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance."
125,"Question: An 80-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to the gradual worsening of confusion and lethargy over the past 5 days. Her son reports that she had recovered from a severe stomach bug with vomiting and diarrhea 3 days ago without seeing a physician or going to the hospital. The patient’s past medical history is notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She takes hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, a children’s aspirin, and a multivitamin, but is not compliant with her medication regimen. Physical examination reveals dry oral mucous membranes, and the patient appears extremely lethargic but arousable. She refuses to answer questions and has extreme difficulty following the conversation. Laboratory results are as follows:

Sodium: 126 mEq/L
Potassium: 3.9 mEq/L

Glucose: 910 mg/dL
Urine ketones: Trace

Which of the following may also be found in this patient?

A. Characteristic breath odor
B. Flapping hand tremor
C. Increased BUN/creatinine ratio
D. Diffuse abdominal pain

Answer: C. Increased BUN/creatinine ratio

Explanation: The patient's elevated BUN/creatinine ratio (10:1) suggests that there is significant kidney dysfunction, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including dehydration, acute kidney injury, and chronic kidney disease. This is a concerning finding in this patient, as it may indicate a more severe underlying condition that requires further evaluation and treatment."
126,"Question: A 29-year-old man presents to the primary care clinic in June for post-discharge follow-up after a recent motor vehicle collision. Which vaccination should be administered at this time?

Options:
A. 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine: Given the patient's recent splenic laceration and the risk of pneumococcal infection, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is the appropriate choice.
B. Inactivated (intramuscular) influenza vaccine: As the patient has not had a recent influenza vaccine and is at risk of complications from influenza, the inactivated (intramuscular) influenza vaccine should be administered.
C. Measles-mumps-rubella vaccine: The patient does not require the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine as he has not been previously vaccinated and is not at risk of measles, mumps, or rubella infection.
D. Tetanus booster vaccine: The patient does not require a tetanus booster vaccine as he has been up-to-date on his vaccinations prior to the accident and has not been exposed to tetanus.

Answer: A. 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine."
127,"Question: A 36-year-old woman experiences recurrent headaches on the right side of her head, accompanied by nausea, worsened by lifting heavy objects, and lasting 2 days. She describes the pain as pulsatile and notes that it is triggered by eating chocolates without an aura. Despite trying over-the-counter medications, she experiences no relief. Which of the following will most likely be the next treatment of choice for acute episodes?

Options:
A. D2 receptor blocker - This option is incorrect because D2 receptor blockers are not typically used to treat pulsatile tinnitus or headaches.
B. Beta-blocker - Beta-blockers are medications that slow the heart rate and reduce blood pressure, but they are not effective in treating headaches or tinnitus.
C. GABA transaminase inhibitor - GABA transaminase inhibitors are not commonly used to treat headaches or tinnitus.
D. 5-HT1B/D agonist - A 5-HT1B/D agonist is the most likely next treatment of choice for acute episodes of the patient's headaches. These medications are specifically designed to target the serotonin receptors in the brain that are involved in headache pathophysiology, and they have been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of pulsatile tinnitus.

Answer: D. 5-HT1B/D agonist"
128,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 1-day history of malaise and abdominal pain. He has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, liver transplantation 12 weeks ago, and recent episodes of vomiting and diarrhea. What is the next appropriate step in his diagnosis?

Options:
A. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast to evaluate for any underlying causes of his abdominal pain and jaundice.
B. Viral loads to determine if he has a viral infection that may be causing his symptoms.
C. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to evaluate for any structural abnormalities in his digestive system and to biopsy any suspicious areas.
D. Ultrasound of the liver to evaluate for any liver function abnormalities and to assess for any signs of liver disease.

Answer: D. Ultrasound of the liver. This is the most appropriate next step in his diagnosis as it will help evaluate for any liver function abnormalities and assess for any signs of liver disease, such as hepatic steatosis or cirrhosis. The other options may not provide sufficient information to accurately diagnose the patient's condition."
129,"Question: An 18-month-old girl is brought to the emergency room by her mother due to wheezing for 1 day, along with a runny nose and cough. The baby is not feeding well and has never had similar symptoms. Her immunizations are up-to-date. Her rectal temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F), the heart rate is 120/min, and the respiratory rate is 23/min. On examination, a clear nasal discharge is noticed with intercostal retractions. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral fine rales and diffuse fine wheezing. A chest X-ray is given in the exhibit. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Bronchial asthma - This is a common respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and constriction of the airways, leading to wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. However, in this case, the baby's age and the presence of a runny nose and cough suggest that bronchiolitis is a more likely diagnosis.

B. Bronchiolitis - This is a common respiratory infection that affects young children, typically under the age of 2. It is caused by a virus and is characterized by inflammation and congestion of the small airways, leading to wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. The presence of a runny nose and cough, along with the baby's age, make bronchiolitis the most likely diagnosis.

C. Bacterial pneumonia - This is a serious infection that can affect the lungs and can cause wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. However, in this case, the baby's age and the presence of a runny nose and cough suggest that bronchiolitis is a more likely diagnosis.

D. Bronchial foreign body - This is a rare condition where an object becomes lodged in the airways and can cause wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. However, in this case, there is no mention of any object being lodged in the baby's airways, making this diagnosis unlikely.

Answer: B. Bronchiolitis"
130,"Question: A 4-year-old girl is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. She has been healthy apart from an episode of bronchiolitis as an infant. Her 6-year-old sister recently underwent surgery for ventricular septal defect closure. She is at the 60th percentile for height and weight. Her mother is concerned about the possibility of the patient having a cardiovascular anomaly. Which of the following is most likely to indicate a benign heart murmur in this child?

Options:
A. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard along the left lower sternal border that increases on valsalva - This option is unlikely to indicate a benign heart murmur in the child. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur suggests a more significant cardiac abnormality, such as a ventricular septal defect or an atrial septal defect, which could potentially be a concern for the child's cardiovascular health.

B. A grade 4/6 midsystolic murmur at the right upper sternal border that increases on rapid squatting - This option is also unlikely to indicate a benign heart murmur in the child. A grade 4/6 midsystolic murmur suggests a more significant cardiac abnormality, such as a ventricular septal defect or an atrial septal defect, which could potentially be a concern for the child's cardiovascular health.

C. A grade 2/6 continuous murmur heard at the right supraclavicular region - This option is the most likely to indicate a benign heart murmur in the child. A grade 2/6 continuous murmur is typically associated with a patent foramen ovale, which is a common congenital heart defect that does not typically cause any significant cardiovascular problems.

D. A grade 4/6 holosytolic murmur heard along the left lower sternal border that increases on hand grip - This option is also unlikely to indicate a benign heart murmur in the child. A grade 4/6 holosytolic murmur suggests a more significant cardiac abnormality, such as a ventricular septal defect or an atrial septal defect, which could potentially be a concern for the child's cardiovascular health.

Answer: C. A grade 2/6 continuous murmur heard at the right supraclavicular region."
131,"Question: The 75-year-old patient with a history of hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, and TIA presents with elevated blood pressure (180/115 mm Hg) and increased creatinine level (1.2 mg/dL). What is the most likely cause of his hypertension?

Options:

A. Renal artery stenosis: The increase in blood pressure could be due to a reduction in renal blood flow, leading to decreased renal perfusion and increased renin release, which can contribute to hypertension.

B. Coarctation of the aorta: A congenital narrowing of the aorta can lead to hypertension in the upper body, as blood flow is restricted and pressure builds up.

C. Pheochromocytoma: This rare tumor of the adrenal gland can cause hypertension due to the excessive production of catecholamines, which can increase blood pressure.

D. Hypothyroidism: While hypothyroidism can cause a slowed heart rate and decreased blood pressure, it is unlikely to cause hypertension in this case, as the patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease.

Answer: A. Renal artery stenosis."
132,"Question: A 52-year-old woman presents to the clinic with complaints of intermittent chest pain for 3 days. The pain is retrosternal, 3/10, and positional (laying down seems to make it worse). She describes it as “squeezing and burning” in quality, is worse after food intake and emotional stress, and improves with antacids. The patient recently traveled for 4 hours in a car. Past medical history is significant for osteoarthritis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, both of which are moderately controlled. Medications include ibuprofen, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. She denies palpitations, dyspnea, shortness of breath, weight loss, fever, melena, or hematochezia. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?

A. Blood clot within the lungs
B. Decreased gastric mucosal protection
C. Incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter
D. Insufficient blood supply to the myocardium

Answer: C. Incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of retrosternal chest pain, positional worsening, and improvement with antacids are consistent with the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is the ring of muscle that separates the esophagus and stomach, and its incompetence can cause reflux of stomach acid and food into the esophagus, leading to chest pain. The patient's history of osteoarthritis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus may increase her risk of developing GERD, and the recent travel may have exacerbated the condition. Blood clots in the lungs, decreased gastric mucosal protection, and insufficient blood supply to the myocardium are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms."
133,"Question: A 59-year-old female presents to the emergency department with an acute onset of weakness in her left hand, along with recent episodes of blurry vision and headaches. Her medical history is unremarkable, except for her daughter's diagnosis of multiple sclerosis at age 23. Examination reveals facial erythema, mild scratch marks on her arms and torso, and slightly decreased strength in her left hand with mild dysmetria of the left hand finger-to-nose testing. Laboratory studies show decreased erythropoietin levels and CT scan of the head without contrast shows two focal areas of hypo-attenuation in the right parietal lobe. Given these findings, the most appropriate treatment to prevent complications of the patient's underlying condition is:

D. Repeated phlebotomies.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with an autoimmune disorder, such as multiple sclerosis. Repeated phlebotomies, or bloodletting, may be necessary to reduce the risk of complications associated with this condition, such as stroke or seizures. Glucocorticoid therapy may also be considered to reduce inflammation and prevent exacerbations, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition. Busulfan is an immunosuppressive drug that may be used to treat autoimmune disorders, but it is not indicated in this case. Imatinib therapy is a treatment option for certain types of leukemia, but it is not relevant to the patient's presentation."
134,"Question: A 60-year-old African American woman presents to her ophthalmologist with blurry vision. She reports a 2-month history of decreased vision primarily affecting her right eye. Her past medical history is notable for type 1 diabetes and hypertension. She takes insulin and enalapril. She has a 40-pack-year smoking history and drinks a glass of wine at dinner each night. Her family history is notable for glaucoma in her mother and severe diabetes complicated by nephropathy and retinopathy in her father. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 134/82 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, she is well-appearing and in no acute distress. The physician asks the patient to look forward and shines a penlight first in one eye, then the other, alternating quickly to observe the pupillary response to the light. When the light is shined in the right eye, both pupils partially constrict. When the light is shined in the left eye, both pupils constrict further. When the light is moved back to the right eye, both eyes dilate slightly to a partially constricted state.

A. Ciliary ganglion: The ciliary ganglion is a part of the parasympathetic nervous system that plays a role in regulating pupillary constriction and dilation. However, in this case, the patient's pupils partially constrict and then dilate further when the light is moved back to the right eye, suggesting that the lesion is likely located higher up in the visual pathway, closer to the optic nerve.

B. Lateral geniculate nucleus: The lateral geniculate nucleus is a part of the visual pathway that receives visual information from the retina and sends it to the occipital lobe for processing. However, in this case, the patient's pupils constrict and then dilate further when the light is moved back to the right eye, suggesting that the lesion is likely located closer to the optic nerve.

C. Oculomotor nerve: The oculomotor nerve is responsible for controlling the movement of the eyeball and regulating pupillary constriction and dilation. However, in this case, the patient's pupils partially constrict and then dilate further when the light is moved back to the right eye, suggesting that the lesion is likely located higher up in the visual pathway, closer to the optic nerve.

D. Optic nerve: The optic nerve is the nerve that carries visual information from the retina to the occipital lobe for processing. In this case, the patient's pupils constrict and then dilate further when the light is moved back to the right eye, suggesting that the lesion is likely located on the optic nerve itself."
135,"Question: An 11-month-old girl presents to a pediatrician with a red discoloration with a rectangular shape over her left buttock, which has been present since the previous night. The mother is concerned about the excessive crying and lack of improvement in the lesion's appearance. There is no history of fever, joint swelling, vomiting, decreased urine output, or change in urine or stool color. The mother also mentions that the child had a self-limiting upper respiratory infection three weeks prior. The mother has a brother with hemophilia A. On examination, the child's temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse rate is 160/min, and respiratory rate is 38/min. The lesion is tender on palpation. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Hemophilia
B. Abusive bruise
C. Erythema multiforme minor
D. Diaper dermatitis

Answer: B. Abusive bruise

Rationale: The history of a self-limiting upper respiratory infection three weeks prior and the lack of any other symptoms suggest that the lesion is most likely due to an abusive bruise. The mother's history of having a brother with hemophilia A also supports this diagnosis, as hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder that can cause bruising. The tender nature of the lesion on palpation also supports this diagnosis. Erythema multiforme minor and diaper dermatitis are less likely causes for the lesion, as they typically present with different symptoms and do not cause tenderness on palpation. Hemophilia is also less likely, as there is no history of bleeding or bruising in the past."
136,"Sure! Here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 29-year-old GP10 woman at 24 weeks estimated gestational age presents for follow-up. Six weeks ago, a complete blood count showed a microcytic hypochromic anemia for which she was prescribed iron sulfate tablets. A repeat complete blood count today shows no improvement in her hemoglobin level. Past medical history is significant for her being Rh-positive with an Rh-negative partner. She emigrated to the United States with her husband 7 years ago and did not have regular medical care in her country. An abdominal ultrasound shows findings consistent with hydrops fetalis. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the condition of her fetus?

Options:
A. Deletion of 4 alpha-globin genes: This genetic disorder results in a deficiency of alpha-globin chains, leading to microcytic hypochromic anemia. It is a rare condition that can occur in individuals with a family history of the disorder or in those who have recently undergone bone marrow or blood transplantation.
B. Impaired synthesis of beta-globin chains: This condition is caused by a deficiency of one of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of beta-globin chains, leading to a decrease in the production of hemoglobin. This can result in microcytic hypochromic anemia.
C. Pyruvate kinase deficiency: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of ATP, leading to a decrease in the production of hemoglobin and resulting in microcytic hypochromic anemia.
D. Rh incompatibility: This is a condition that occurs when the mother is Rh-positive and the fetus is Rh-negative, leading to the production of anti-Rh antibodies in the mother's bloodstream. This can cause hemolysis and anemia in the fetus.

Answer: A. Deletion of 4 alpha-globin genes."
137,"Question: A 72-year-old man presents to the physician with complaints of fatigue and a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months, despite a good appetite. He has no medical history of note, does not smoke or use illicit drugs, and takes no medications. On physical examination, he has hepatosplenomegaly and diffuse, nontender lymphadenopathy. Laboratory studies reveal a hemoglobin concentration of 11 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 16,000/mm3, with a direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test showing a positive result. A photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear is shown. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely?

A. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
B. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
C. Follicular lymphoma (FL)
D. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)

Answer: D. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of fatigue and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, are consistent with CLL. The direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test being positive also supports this diagnosis. CLL is a common type of leukemia that affects B cells and is characterized by the accumulation of malignant B cells in the blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues. The photomicrograph of the peripheral blood smear shown in the question is consistent with the characteristic small, dark-staining cells seen in CLL. While AML and FL are also possibilities based on the laboratory results, the patient's age and symptoms, along with the physical examination findings, make CLL the most likely diagnosis."
138,"Question: A 6-day-old newborn girl is brought to the hospital due to excessive vomiting and poor feeding. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure is 50/30 mm Hg, and pulse is 150/min. On examination, the infant is dehydrated and shows signs of shock. Her genitalia are ambiguous, with fused labia and an enlarged clitoris. Laboratory results reveal:

Serum sodium (Na) - 125 mEq/L
Serum potassium (K) - 6 mEq/L
Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone - 100,000 ng/dL (normal range is 1,000-3,000 ng/dL)

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's condition?

A. Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase
B. Deficiency of 11-beta-hydroxylase
C. Deficiency of 17-alpha-hydroxylase
D. Deficiency of placental aromatase

Answer: A. Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase

Explanation: The high level of serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (100,000 ng/dL) and the ambiguous genitalia are consistent with a diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which is caused by a deficiency of 21-hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for converting 17-hydroxyprogesterone to the inactive metabolite, 17-hydroxypregesterone. Without sufficient 21-hydroxylase activity, 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels are elevated, leading to the characteristic signs of CAH, including ambiguous genitalia and virilization. The other options are less likely causes of this condition based on the laboratory results and clinical presentation."
139,"Question: A 21-year-old female presents to the family physician with 3 weeks of headaches, sweating, and palpitations. Her BP was 160/125 mmHg, and a 24-hour urine test revealed elevated vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and normetanephrine. Past medical history is notable for bilateral retinal hemangioblastomas, and family history is significant for three generations (patient, mother, and maternal grandfather) with similar symptoms. Genetic analysis revealed a mutation of a gene on chromosome 3p. Which of the following is the patient at risk of developing?

A. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma: The patient's elevated VMA and normetanephrine levels, along with the family history of similar symptoms and genetic mutation on chromosome 3p, suggest a high risk of developing pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor that can develop in the adrenal gland and produce excessive catecholamines. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer that is unrelated to the patient's symptoms and genetic mutation.

B. Retinoblastoma: The patient's history of bilateral retinal hemangioblastomas, which are benign tumors that can occur in the retina, does not increase the risk of developing retinoblastoma, which is a rare malignant tumor that occurs in the retina.

C. Osteosarcoma: There is no relationship between the patient's symptoms or genetic mutation and the development of osteosarcoma, a rare type of bone cancer.

D. Breast cancer: There is no association between the patient's symptoms or genetic mutation and the risk of developing breast cancer, which is a common type of cancer that affects the breast tissue."
140,"Question: A 46-year-old woman presents to the clinic with complaints of right eye irritation, itchiness, and redness that have persisted for 6 months. She has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and aggressive tooth decay. Which of the following is the best next step in her management?

Options:
A. Artificial tears - This is the best option as the patient's symptoms are consistent with dry eye syndrome, which can be treated with artificial tears.
B. Fundoscopy - This is not the best option as there is no indication of a foreign object in the eye or any other pathology that would require a fundoscopic examination.
C. Erythromycin ointment - This is not the best option as the patient's symptoms are not caused by bacterial infection, and erythromycin is not an appropriate treatment for dry eye syndrome.
D. Retinoscopy - This is not the best option as there is no indication of any abnormalities in the retina that would require a retinoscopic examination.

Answer: A. Artificial tears."
141,"Question: A 29-year-old man presents to an STD clinic complaining of a painful lesion at the end of his penis. The patient says it started as a tiny red bump and grew over several days. He has no history of a serious illness and takes no medications. He has had several sexual partners in the past few months. At the clinic, his temperature is 38.2℃ (100.8℉), the blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 84/min, and the respirations are 14/min. Examination of the inguinal area shows enlarged and tender lymph nodes, some of which are fluctuant. There is an ulcerated and weeping sore with an erythematous base and ragged edges on the end of his penis. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. The result of the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) is negative. Which of the following diagnoses best explains these findings?

A. Chancre: A chancre is a small, painless ulcer that typically appears at the site of infection, usually within 2-6 weeks after exposure. It is a common symptom of syphilis, but can also be seen in other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, the patient's recent sexual history and the absence of other symptoms suggest that chancroid is a more likely diagnosis.

B. Chancroid: Chancroid is a bacterial STI that is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. It typically presents with a painful, ulcerated sore at the site of infection, which can be found on the penis, vulva, or anal area. The sore may be accompanied by swollen and tender lymph nodes, fever, and fatigue. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with chancroid.

C. Condyloma acuminatum: Condyloma acuminatum is a common STI caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). It typically presents as a small, rough, wart-like lesion on the genital area. However, the patient's lesion is located on the end of his penis and does not fit the typical presentation of condyloma acuminatum.

D. Lymphogranuloma venereum: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a rare STI caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. It typically presents with painless, non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy and a single, painless ulcer on the penis or perineum. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not match the typical presentation of LGV.

Answer: B. Chancroid"
142,"Question: A 14-month-old boy is brought in by his parents with an 8-month history of diarrhea, abdominal tenderness, and concomitant failure to thrive. The pediatric attending physician believes that Crohn's disease is the best explanation of this patient's symptoms. Based on the pediatric attending physician's experience, the pretest probability of this diagnosis is estimated at 40%. According to Fagan nomogram (see image), if the likelihood ratio of a negative test result (LR-) for Crohn's disease is 0.04, what is the chance that this is the correct diagnosis in this patient with a negative test result?

Options:

A. 2.5% - The chance that the patient has Crohn's disease is low, given the negative test result. The Fagan nomogram suggests that the probability of the diagnosis decreases significantly with a negative test result.

B. 25% - The probability of the diagnosis is higher than the previous option, but still relatively low. The Fagan nomogram indicates that a negative test result does not completely rule out the possibility of Crohn's disease.

C. 40% - The probability of the diagnosis is higher than the previous options, as the pediatric attending physician's experience suggests that Crohn's disease is a likely explanation for the patient's symptoms. However, the negative test result still reduces the probability of the diagnosis.

D. 97.5% - The probability of the diagnosis is extremely high, which is unlikely based on the information provided. A negative test result does not necessarily rule out the possibility of Crohn's disease, but the probability is still relatively low.

Answer: A. 2.5%"
143,"Question: An investigator studying influenza virus variability isolates several distinct influenza virus strains from the respiratory secretions of a study subject. Mass spectrometry analysis of one strain shows that it expresses neuraminidase on its surface. Subsequent sequencing of this strain shows that its genome lacks the neuraminidase gene. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this finding?

Options:
A. Transduction - This option is incorrect because transduction is the process of inserting genetic material into a cell, rather than removing it.
B. Reassortment - This option is incorrect because reassortment is the process of shuffling genetic material between different viral strains, rather than removing a gene from a virus.
C. Phenotypic mixing - This is the most likely explanation for the finding. Phenotypic mixing occurs when a virus expresses one gene but lacks the corresponding gene in its genome. This can occur due to a variety of mechanisms, including RNA editing, alternative splicing, or the presence of a wild-type gene that is not expressed.
D. Complementation - This option is incorrect because complementation refers to the process of providing a functional gene to compensate for a missing gene, rather than removing a gene from a virus.

Answer: C. Phenotypic mixing."
144,"Question:

29-year-old G2P2002 presents with foul-smelling lochia and fever. She is post-partum day three status-post cesarean section due to eclampsia. Her temperature is 101 F, and heart rate is 103. She denies chills. On physical exam, lower abdominal and uterine tenderness is present. Leukocytosis with left shift is seen in labs. Which of the following is the next best step in management?

Options:

A. Endometrial culture
B. Intravenous clindamycin and gentamicin treatment
C. Intramuscular cefotetan treatment
D. Prophylactic intravenous cefazolin treatment

Answer: B. Intravenous clindamycin and gentamicin treatment

Rationale:

The patient's symptoms of foul-smelling lochia and fever, along with her history of eclampsia, suggest a possible infection. Clindamycin and gentamicin are effective antibiotics against a wide range of bacteria, including those commonly causing post-partum infections. Intravenous administration of these antibiotics is the most effective way to deliver them to the patient's body and ensure adequate coverage of any potential infection.

Endometrial culture is not a necessary step in management, as it is not a diagnostic test for post-partum infections. Intramuscular cefotetan treatment may be effective against some bacterial infections, but it may not be as effective as intravenous antibiotics in treating sepsis. Prophylactic intravenous cefazolin treatment is not recommended in this scenario, as the patient is already experiencing symptoms of infection."
145,"Question: A 41-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with chest pain. She has had progressive substernal chest pain accompanied by weakness and mild shortness of breath for the past 2 hours. Her past medical history is notable for poorly controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren syndrome, and interstitial lung disease. She was hospitalized last year with pericarditis presumed to be from SLE. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 106/56 mmHg, pulse is 132/min, and respirations are 26/min. On exam, the skin overlying the internal jugular vein fills at 9 cm above the sternal angle and distant heart sounds are appreciated. There is no friction rub. She is given 1000cc of intravenous fluids with no appreciable change in her blood pressure. An electrocardiogram in this patient would most likely reveal which of the following findings?

A. ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF
B. Polymorphic P waves
C. Wide QRS complexes with no P waves
D. QRS complex height variation

Answer: D. QRS complex height variation

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that she may be experiencing an acute coronary event, such as a myocardial infarction (heart attack). An electrocardiogram (ECG) would be used to confirm this diagnosis and determine the extent of the damage to the heart muscle.

In this case, the QRS complex height variation is the most likely finding on the ECG. This refers to the variation in the height of the QRS complex, which is the time interval between the beginning of the QRS complex and the beginning of the R wave. In acute coronary syndrome, the QRS complex height may be prolonged or varied, indicating that the electrical activity of the heart is affected.

The other options are less likely findings on an ECG in this patient:

* ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF (option A) are a more specific indicator of acute coronary syndrome, but they are not as common as QRS complex height variation.
* Polymorphic P waves (option B) are variations in the P wave that can occur in a variety of cardiac conditions, but they are not typically seen in acute coronary syndrome.
* Wide QRS complexes with no P waves (option C) can also occur in a variety of cardiac conditions, but they are not specific to acute coronary syndrome.

Therefore, the answer is D. QRS complex height variation."
146,"Question: A 3-month-old boy visits his pediatrician with persistent diarrhea, oral thrush, and signs of RSV pneumonia. He is very underweight, weighing only 10th percentile. His blood pressure is 105/64 mm Hg and heart rate is 84/min. He is being evaluated for an immunodeficiency. HIV tests are negative by PCR. What is the most likely reason for this child's symptoms?

Options:
A. An X-linked inheritance of HLA genes
B. Defective T cell function
C. Selective IgA deficiency
D. Grossly reduced levels of B cells

Answer: B. Defective T cell function.

Explanation: The child's symptoms of persistent diarrhea, oral thrush, and RSV pneumonia are consistent with a primary immunodeficiency disorder. Defective T cell function is a common cause of primary immunodeficiency disorders, which can lead to recurrent infections and other immune-related problems. HIV tests are negative, which rules out HIV infection as a cause. Selective IgA deficiency and grossly reduced levels of B cells are also possible causes of immunodeficiency, but they are less likely in this case based on the child's symptoms and laboratory results."
147,"Question: A 59-year-old man presents to the physician with a 4-month history of pruritic rash that has not improved despite over-the-counter cream treatment. He has also experienced a 6-kg (13.5-lb) weight loss. Examination reveals a scaly rash on his chest, back, and thighs, with a photograph of the rash on his thighs provided. A biopsy of the skin lesions shows clusters of neoplastic cells with cerebriform nuclei within the epidermis. Which of the following cell types is most likely responsible for the patient's condition?

Options:
A. T cells - T cells are a type of immune cell that play a crucial role in cell-mediated immunity. The abnormal proliferation of T cells could lead to the development of a pruritic rash and skin lesions.
B. Keratinocytes - Keratinocytes are the main cell type in the epidermis, and their abnormal proliferation can cause skin lesions and rashes.
C. Mast cells - Mast cells are immune cells that play a role in allergic reactions and inflammation. Their abnormal proliferation could contribute to the development of a pruritic rash.
D. B cells - B cells are a type of immune cell that produce antibodies to fight infections. While B cells are not directly involved in the development of skin lesions, their abnormal proliferation could lead to an immune-mediated response that contributes to the patient's condition.

Answer: A. T cells - The biopsy result showing clusters of neoplastic cells with cerebriform nuclei within the epidermis suggests the presence of a T-cell-mediated immune response, which is consistent with the patient's pruritic rash and skin lesions."
148,"Question: A 52-year-old African American man presents to his primary care physician with a chief complaint of leg swelling. He says that the swelling began about 2 weeks ago and he cannot recall anything that may have provoked the episode. Otherwise he has had joint pain, headaches, frothy urine, and some tingling in his fingers and toes though he doesn't feel that any of this is related to his swelling. He denies any shortness of breath, back pain, or skull pain. His past medical history is significant for mild rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and hypertension all of which are well controlled. Physical exam reveals 3+ pitting edema in his legs bilaterally. A chest radiograph reveals mild enlargement of the cardiac shadow. Urinalysis reveals 3+ protein and casts with a cross appearance under polarized light. A renal biopsy is taken with a characteristic finding seen only under polarized light. Which of the following is associated with the most likely cause of this patient's edema?

A. Abnormally shaped red blood cells
B. Altered kappa to lambda ratio
C. Antibodies to phospholipase A2 receptor
D. Elevated levels of IL-6

Answer: D. Elevated levels of IL-6

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of leg swelling, joint pain, headaches, and tingling in his fingers and toes are consistent with nephrotic syndrome, a condition characterized by excessive loss of large amounts of protein in the urine. The finding of 3+ protein and casts with a cross appearance under polarized light on urinalysis, along with the renal biopsy finding of membranous nephropathy, further supports this diagnosis. Elevated levels of IL-6, a cytokine that plays a role in the inflammatory response, are commonly seen in patients with nephrotic syndrome, particularly those with membranous nephropathy. Therefore, option D is the best answer."
149,"Question: A 21-year-old woman presents to the women's clinic with chronic pelvic pain, especially during sexual intercourse, and reports new onset yellowish vaginal discharge. She has no significant past medical history, does not take contraceptive pills, smokes 2-3 cigarettes daily, and drinks beer on weekends. She admits to being sexually active with over 10 partners since the age of 14. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Ectopic pregnancy: While ectopic pregnancy can cause pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding, it is less likely in this case as the patient is not experiencing any other symptoms typical of ectopic pregnancy such as abdominal pain, shoulder pain, or bleeding.

B. Bacterial vaginosis: This is a common infection caused by an imbalance of bacteria in the vagina, which can cause yellowish discharge, pelvic pain, and vaginal itching. However, the patient's temperature is normal, and the whiff test is negative, which are not typical findings in bacterial vaginosis.

C. Urinary tract infection: While urinary tract infections can cause pelvic pain and discharge, they are less likely in this case as the patient does not have any symptoms typical of a urinary tract infection such as frequency, urgency, or abdominal pain.

D. Pelvic inflammatory disease: This is a common infection that affects the reproductive organs in women, causing pelvic pain, fever, and vaginal discharge. The patient's history of sexual activity and recent onset of symptoms are consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease. The tender adnexa and uterus with cervical motion tenderness on bimanual examination, as well as the elevated vaginal pH, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pelvic inflammatory disease.

Answer: D. Pelvic inflammatory disease."
150,"Question: A 78-year-old woman presents to the physician with a 2-month history of right-sided headache and generalized fatigue, along with pain, weakness, and stiffness in her shoulders and hips. She also reports a recent fall and hit to the head. Examination reveals mildly limited range of motion in her shoulders and hips, along with 2+ deep tendon reflexes. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 68 mm/h and serum creatine kinase is 36 mg/dL. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be the underlying cause of her headache?

A. Tension headache
B. Large-vessel vasculitis
C. Hyperthyroidism
D. Cluster headache

Answer: B. Large-vessel vasculitis

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of headache, fatigue, and muscle weakness, along with the limited range of motion in her shoulders and hips, are consistent with large-vessel vasculitis. The recent fall and hit to the head may have triggered the vasculitis, which is causing inflammation in the blood vessels and leading to the symptoms. The mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum creatine kinase level support this diagnosis, as they are indicative of inflammation in the body. Tension headache, hyperthyroidism, and cluster headache are less likely causes for the patient's symptoms based on the presented information."
151,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 58-year-old woman is rushed to the emergency department due to shortness of breath and chest pain. Pulmonary angiography reveals a large saddle embolus in her pulmonary arteries. She is given emergency medication and admitted to the hospital for observation. A follow-up CT scan of her chest shortly after admission shows that the clot has dissolved. However, five hours later, she becomes lethargic and develops slurred speech, along with decreased consciousness, dysarthria, and optic disc swelling on both sides of her brain. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her current neurological symptoms?

Options:
A. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)
B. Drug-induced hypotension
C. Embolic cerebrovascular accident (ECA)
D. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)

Answer: D. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)"

Options:
A. Lysine : The amino acid isolated has a net charge of +1, which is consistent with the positive charge of lysine.
B. Aspartate : Aspartate has a net charge of +2, which is different from the +1 charge of the isolated amino acid.
C. Histidine : Histidine has a net charge of +2, which is also different from the +1 charge of the isolated amino acid.
D. Proline : Proline has a net charge of 0, which is different from the +1 charge of the isolated amino acid.

Answer: A. Lysine."
153,"Question: A 37-year-old G3P2 is referred to a gynecologist by her physician to follow-up on the results of some screening tests. She has a history of 1 medical abortion and 2 vaginal deliveries. The most recent labor, which occurred at 31 years of age, was induced at 41 weeks gestation with prostaglandin application to the cervix, and was complicated by a cervical laceration. A Pap smear obtained 1 year ago showed a low-grade intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), but HPV testing was negative. Currently, the patient reports no symptoms. Her husband is her only sexual partner. She uses oral contraception. She does not have any co-existing diseases. The HPV test performed at the patient’s last evaluation by her physician was positive. The Pap smear results were as follows:

Specimen adequacy: satisfactory for evaluation
Interpretation: high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL)

A colposcopic examination is performed, but deemed inadequate due to cervical scarring with a partial obliteration of the external os. The lesion can be seen at the 7–8 o’clock position occupying 1/2 of the visible right lower quadrant of the cervix with a dense acetowhite epithelium and coarse punctuation. The cervical scar interferes with identification of the margins and extension of the lesion into the cervical canal. Which of the following would be the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?

Answer: C. Cold-knife conization

Explanation: Cold-knife conization is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. The patient has a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) that is not adequately evaluated by colposcopy due to cervical scarring. Cold-knife conization is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of the abnormal cells from the cervix, and it is the most effective way to diagnose and treat precancerous changes in the cervix. The other options, cryoablation, laser ablation, and punch biopsy, are not appropriate for this patient's condition."
154,"Sure! Here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 45-year-old woman visits her physician with a 3-week history of intermittent episodes of dizziness. During these episodes, she experiences the sensation that the room is spinning. She has also noticed that she has been using her cell phone more with her left ear because she hears better on that side. Additionally, she has experienced intermittent ringing and fullness in her right ear. The patient has no significant medical history, does not smoke or drink alcohol, and takes no medications. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), her pulse is 76/min, her respirations are 18/min, and her blood pressure is 130/76 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination reveals no abnormalities, and there is horizontal nystagmus to the right. Motor strength is 5/5 in all extremities, and sensory examination shows no abnormalities. Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing are normal bilaterally. The Weber test shows lateralization to the left ear, and the Rinne test is positive bilaterally. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

A. Reduced resorption of endolymph: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a condition known as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is caused by reduced resorption of endolymph in the inner ear. This condition can lead to episodes of dizziness and vertigo triggered by changes in head position.

B. Occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery: This condition can cause vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss in the affected ear. However, in this case, the patient does not have any evidence of cerebellar artery occlusion on examination.

C. Cerebellopontine angle tumor: This is a rare condition that can cause vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. However, there is no evidence of a tumor in the patient's inner ear or brain stem.

D. Obstruction of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery: This condition can cause vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss in the affected ear. However, in this case, the patient does not have any evidence of cerebellar artery obstruction on examination."
155,"Question: An investigator studying DNA mutation mechanisms isolates single-stranded DNA from a recombinant bacteriophage and sequences it. The investigator then mixes it with a buffer solution and incubates the resulting mixture at 70°C for 16 hours. Subsequent DNA resequencing shows that 3.7 per 1,000 cytosine residues have mutated to uracil. Which of the following best describes the role of the enzyme that is responsible for the initial step in repairing these types of mutations in living cells?

Options:

A. Cleavage of the phosphodiester bond 3' of damaged site: This option is incorrect because the enzyme responsible for repairing cytosine mutations is not involved in cleaving the phosphodiester bond 3' of the damaged site.

B. Addition of free nucleotides to 3' end: This option is also incorrect because the enzyme responsible for repairing cytosine mutations is not involved in adding free nucleotides to the 3' end of the damaged DNA.

C. Connecting the phosphodiester backbone: This option is incorrect because the enzyme responsible for repairing cytosine mutations is not involved in connecting the phosphodiester backbone of the damaged DNA.

D. Creation of empty sugar-phosphate site: This is the correct answer. The enzyme responsible for repairing cytosine mutations is an DNA glycosylase, which creates an empty sugar-phosphate site at the position of the mutated cytosine. This creates a recognition site for the repair enzyme, which can then fill in the gap with the correct nucleotide.

Answer: D. Creation of empty sugar-phosphate site."
156,"Question: A 66-year-old man presents to his family physician complaining of a sandpaper-like sensation when he touches the lesion on his forehead. His medical history is relevant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, for which he is taking losartan and atorvastatin. He used to work as a gardener, but he retired 3 years ago. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination of his forehead reveals male-pattern baldness and thin, adherent, yellow-colored skin lesions that feel rough to the touch (see image). His family physician refers to him to a dermatologist for further management and treatment. Which of the following conditions would the patient most likely develop if this skin condition is left untreated?

A. Basal cell carcinoma: Basal cell carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis if the patient's skin condition is left untreated. This type of skin cancer typically affects the sun-exposed areas of the body, such as the face, ears, and arms, and can cause rough, scaly patches or nodules to form. If left untreated, basal cell carcinoma can grow deeper into the skin and potentially spread to other parts of the body, leading to more severe complications.

B. Squamous cell carcinoma: Squamous cell carcinoma is another potential diagnosis if the patient's skin condition is left untreated. This type of skin cancer can occur anywhere on the body and can cause firm, flat, or raised bumps that may be pink, red, or scaly in appearance. If left untreated, squamous cell carcinoma can grow deeper into the skin and potentially spread to other parts of the body, leading to more severe complications.

C. Mycosis fungoides: Mycosis fungoides is a rare diagnosis in this scenario. This condition is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that can cause skin lesions to develop gradually over time. While it is possible for the patient's skin condition to be related to mycosis fungoides if left untreated, this diagnosis is less likely compared to basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.

D. Seborrheic keratosis: Seborrheic keratosis is also a less likely diagnosis in this scenario. This condition is a benign growth that can occur on the skin, often in a patchy or mottled pattern. While seborrheic keratosis can cause skin irritation or discomfort, it is not typically associated with the rough, sandpaper-like sensation described in the patient's symptoms.

In conclusion, the patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that basal cell carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis if their skin condition is left untreated. It is important for the patient to follow up with their dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment to prevent any potential complications."
157,"Question: A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue. What is the next best step in management?

Options:
A. Colonoscopy
B. CT scan of the abdomen
C. CT scan of the chest
D. Lower extremity ultrasound

Answer: B. CT scan of the abdomen

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue, along with the discovery of multiple tender palpable masses in the lower extremities, suggest the possibility of an abdominal malignancy. A CT scan of the abdomen can help to further evaluate the cause of the patient's symptoms and identify any potential underlying conditions, such as a tumor or inflammatory process. While a colonoscopy may also be considered to evaluate the colon and rectum, a CT scan of the abdomen is the next best step in management given the patient's symptoms and medical history."
158,"Question: A 6-month-old boy is brought to the pediatrician for multiple swellings on his scalp. His mother reports that she first noticed 3 softened and swollen areas over the child's scalp 2 months ago that have grown in size. The child is also urinating more frequently than usual. He was born by cesarean section at 39 weeks gestation. The mother had appropriate prenatal care. She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease for which she takes omeprazole. Her family history is unknown as she was adopted at a young age. The boy's temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 20/min. On exam, he has 3 areas of soft tissue swelling on his skull that are tender to palpation. Moderate asymmetric exophthalmos is noted. A water deprivation test is performed which demonstrates a urine specific gravity of 1.005. The urine specific gravity rises with desmopression administration. A head computerized tomography (CT) scan is performed which demonstrates multifocal lytic calvarial lesions. A biopsy of one of the lesions is performed. Analysis of the biopsy would most likely reveal which of the following findings?

A. Atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei
B. B cells with hair-like cytoplasmic projections
C. Proliferative monoclonal plasma cells
D. Rod-shaped granules with a latticed matrix

Answer: D. Rod-shaped granules with a latticed matrix.

The biopsy of the lesion in the child's scalp would likely reveal the presence of rod-shaped granules with a latticed matrix, which are characteristic of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is a rare genetic disorder that causes non-cancerous tumors to grow in various organs, including the brain, kidneys, and skin. The lesions in this case are multifocal and lytic, which is consistent with TSC. The presence of rod-shaped granules with a latticed matrix on biopsy is a diagnostic feature of TSC."
159,"Question: A 24-year-old woman seeks preconception advice from her physician. She is recently married and plans to conceive soon, with menses occurring at regular 28-day intervals and lasting 5 days, accompanied by sexual intercourse with her husband only, who they consistently use condoms for birth control. She follows a balanced diet with moderate intake of meat and dairy products, has no history of serious illness, takes no medications, and does not smoke or drink alcohol. The patient's family history is unremarkable, and physical examination and pelvic examination reveal no abnormalities. To minimize the likelihood of fetal neural-tube defects in her future pregnancy, which of the following recommendations is most appropriate for initiating folic acid supplementation?

A. Begin supplementation as soon as possible.
B. Wait until the second half of pregnancy.
C. Start supplementation when off contraception.
D. No folic acid supplementation is necessary due to adequate nutritional sources.

Answer: A. As soon as possible"
160,"Question: A 35-year-old man and his 9-year-old son are brought to the emergency department following a high-speed motor vehicle collision. The father was the restrained driver. He is conscious. His pulse is 135/min and his blood pressure is 76/55 mm Hg. His hemoglobin concentration is 5.9 g/dL. His son sustained multiple body contusions and loss of consciousness. He remains unresponsive in the emergency department. A focused assessment of the boy with sonography is concerning for multiple organ lacerations and internal bleeding. The physician decides to move the man's son to the operating room for emergency surgical exploration. The father says that he and his son are Jehovah's witnesses and do not want blood transfusions. The physician calls the boy's biological mother who confirms this religious belief. She also asks the physician to wait for her arrival before any other medical decisions are undertaken. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step for the physician?

A. Consult hospital ethics committee for medical treatment of the son - This option is not the most appropriate next step for the physician as the ethics committee is not directly involved in the medical treatment of the patient.

B. Proceed to surgery on the son without transfusion - This option is not the most appropriate next step for the physician as the father's religious beliefs and the potential risks associated with surgery without blood transfusions need to be taken into consideration.

C. Seek a court order for medical treatment of the son - This option is not the most appropriate next step for the physician as it is not necessary to involve the court in the medical treatment of the patient.

D. Transfuse packed red blood cells to the son but not to father - This is the most appropriate next step for the physician as it respects the father's religious beliefs while ensuring the necessary medical treatment for the son."
161,"Question: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with persistent fatigue and bilateral leg swelling. Her vital signs are as follows: pulse rate: 92/min, respirations: 24/min. Physical examination reveals jugular venous distension and pitting edema of the lower extremities. Abdominal examination shows distended abdomen with shifting dullness and tender hepatomegaly. Cardiovascular examination reveals a holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border that intensifies with inspiration. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause for this patient's condition?

A. 45,XO genotype
B. Intravenous drug use
C. Fibrillin gene defect
D. Streptococcal pharyngitis

Answer: B. Intravenous drug use

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of fatigue and bilateral leg swelling, along with the abdominal distension and tender hepatomegaly, are consistent with nephrotic syndrome, a condition commonly associated with intravenous drug use. Nephrotic syndrome occurs when the kidneys leak large amounts of protein into the urine, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's holosystolic murmur is also consistent with cardiac involvement, which can occur in nephrotic syndrome due to the increased pressure on the heart to compensate for the loss of fluid and electrolytes. The other options are less likely to be the underlying cause of the patient's condition."
162,"Question: A 42-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of subjective fever, cough, and night sweats. He states that over the past 2 months he has “not felt like myself.” He has lost 12 lbs over this time period. Two weeks ago, he started experiencing night sweats and cough. This morning he decided to take his temperature and reports it was “high.” He has a history of HIV and admits to inconsistently taking his anti-retrovirals. A chest radiograph reveals a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe. An interferon-gamma release assay is positive, and the patient is started on appropriate antimicrobial therapy. A month later he is seen in clinic for follow-up. Lab work is obtained, as shown below:

Leukocyte count: 11,000/mm^3 with normal differential
Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
Platelet count: 400,000/mm^3
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 75 µm^3

Based on these results, a peripheral smear is sent and shows Pappenheimer bodies. Which of the following is the most accurate test for the patient’s diagnosis?

D. Prussian blue staining

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of subjective fever, cough, and night sweats, along with the finding of Pappenheimer bodies on peripheral smear, strongly suggest the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). Prussian blue staining is a specific test for detecting hemosiderin deposition, which is a hallmark of TB. Therefore, the most accurate test for the patient's diagnosis is D. Prussian blue staining.

Option A, genetic testing, is not relevant to the patient's diagnosis as TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and does not involve genetic mutations.

Option B, iron studies, are not related to the patient's diagnosis as TB does not affect iron levels.

Option C, methylmalonic acid level, is also not relevant to the patient's diagnosis as TB does not affect methylmalonic acid levels."
163,"Question: A 25-year-old male is brought to the emergency department by his friends after a camping trip. He and his friends were in the woods camping when the patient started experiencing severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain after foraging and ingesting some wild mushrooms about 3 hours earlier. The patient is lethargic on exam and appears jaundiced. He has scleral icterus and is severely tender to palpation in the right upper quadrant. He has scattered petechiae on his extremities. Liver function tests are:

Serum:
Na+: 134 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.2 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen: 50 mg/dL
Glucose: 100 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase: 400 U/L
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, GOT): 3278 U/L
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, GPT): 3045 U/L
gamma-Glutamyltransferase (GGT): 100 U/L

The most likely cause of this patient’s clinical presentation acts by inhibiting which of the following molecules?

A. RNA polymerase II
B. RNA polymerase III
C. Prokaryote RNA polymerase
D. Topoisomerase

Answer: A. RNA polymerase II

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, lethargy, jaundice, and scattered petechiae on his extremities are consistent with acute liver injury. The elevated liver enzymes, particularly AST and ALT, indicate that the liver is undergoing rapid cell death, which is a hallmark of acute liver injury.

RNA polymerase II is the enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA in the liver. The inhibition of RNA polymerase II by certain toxins can lead to the rapid accumulation of RNA in the liver, which can cause liver cell death and acute liver injury. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's clinical presentation is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II by the wild mushrooms he ingested.

RNA polymerase III is involved in the transcription of small RNAs in prokaryotes, and its inhibition is not directly linked to liver injury. Prokaryote RNA polymerase is not a relevant factor in liver function. Topoisomerase is an enzyme that helps to relieve topological constraints in DNA during replication and transcription, but its inhibition is not known to cause liver injury.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) RNA polymerase II."
164,"Question: A 59-year-old Caucasian man with a history of hypertension and emphysema is brought to the hospital because of progressive lethargy and confusion. The patient has been experiencing poor appetite for the past 3 months and has unintentionally lost 9 kg (19.8 lb). He was a smoker for 35 years and smoked 1 pack daily, but he quit 5 years ago. He takes lisinopril and bisoprolol for hypertension and has no allergies. On examination, the patient appears cachectic. He responds to stimulation but is lethargic and unable to provide any significant history. His blood pressure is 138/90 mm Hg, heart rate is 100/min, and his oxygen saturation on room air is 90%. His mucous membranes are moist, heart rate is regular without murmurs or an S3/S4 gallop, and his extremities are without any edema. His pulmonary examination shows mildly diminished breath sounds in the right lower lobe with bilateral wheezing. His laboratory values are shown:

Sodium 110 mEq/L
Potassium 4.1 mEq/L
Chloride 102 mEq/L
CO2 41 mm Hg
BUN 18
Creatinine 1.3 mg/dL
Glucose 93 mg/dL

WBC 8,200 cells/mL
Hgb 15.5 g/dL
Arterial blood gas pH 7.36/pCO2 60/pO2 285
Chest X-ray demonstrates a mass in the right upper lobe. What is the most appropriate treatment to address the patient’s hyponatremia?

Answer: C. 3% saline at 35 mL/h.

Rationale: Hyponatremia is a common complication in patients with chronic lung disease, particularly those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's hyponatremia is likely due to the excessive fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can occur due to the respiratory failure. Administering 3% saline at a rate of 35 mL/h will help to replace the lost fluids and correct the hyponatremia. Dextrose with 20 mEq/L KCl at 250 mL/h may also be effective in correcting hyponatremia, but it may not be the best choice in this patient given the patient's history of hypertension and the potential for volume overload. 0.45% saline at 100 mL/h is not the best choice as it may not provide enough sodium and potassium replacement. 0.45% saline with 30 mEq/L KCl at 100 mL/h is also not the best choice as it may cause volume overload."
165,"Question: A 50-year-old man presents with a sudden onset of severe, right periorbital pain, ipsilateral throbbing headache, and blurred vision for the past hour. The patient reports that he was out walking with his friend when he experienced shortness of breath, and his friend provided him with a puff of his rescue inhaler, which temporarily relieved his breathlessness. However, soon after, the patient's eye symptoms began. No significant past medical history is revealed. His pulse is 100/min and regular, respirations are 18/min, temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F), and blood pressure is 130/86 mmHg. On physical examination, his right pupil is fixed and dilated, and fundoscopic examination of the right eye is difficult due to 'clouding' of the cornea. Tonometry reveals increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Ibuprofen, acetazolamide, timolol, pilocarpine, and topical prednisolone are administered, but the patient's symptoms are only slightly reduced. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?

A. Administer systemic steroids.
B. Get an urgent ophthalmology consultation.
C. Add latanoprost.
D. Perform emergency iridotomy.

Answer: B. Get an urgent ophthalmology consultation.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of severe eye pain, dilated pupils, and difficulty with fundoscopic examination of the right eye suggest a possible case of acute angle closure glaucoma. This is an emergency situation that requires prompt management by an ophthalmologist. While systemic steroids may be considered for short-term relief of IOP, it is important to consult with an ophthalmologist urgently to determine the underlying cause of the angle closure and to initiate appropriate treatment. Latanoprost is not a suitable option in this case as it is a topical drug used to reduce IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma, not acute angle closure glaucoma. Performing emergency iridotomy is also not a viable option in this scenario as it is a surgical procedure that is typically performed in a controlled clinical setting under anesthesia, and is not appropriate for an emergency situation."
166,"Question: A 37-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of fatigue and pale complexion, despite appearing healthy otherwise. Blood tests reveal abnormalities in his hemoglobin, platelet count, mean corpuscular volume, iron, and ferritin levels. Based on these findings, which of the following parasitic organisms is most likely to be the cause of his condition?

Options:
A. Double-stranded virus
B. Nematode
C. Mosquito-borne protozoa
D. Single-stranded virus

Answer: B. Nematode

Explanation: The patient's abnormal blood test results, particularly the low hemoglobin and platelet count, along with the elevated mean corpuscular volume and low ferritin levels, are consistent with a nematode infection. Nematodes are a type of parasitic worm that can infect the bloodstream and cause anemia and other hematological abnormalities. The absence of urine hemoglobin also supports this diagnosis, as nematodes do not typically enter the urinary system. Double-stranded viruses, mosquito-borne protozoa, and single-stranded viruses are less likely to cause these specific abnormalities in the blood test results."
167,"Question: A recent study reveals that nearly 40% of antibiotics prescribed by primary care physicians in an outpatient setting are for patients with a viral acute respiratory tract infection. Given the available evidence, which of the following strategies is most likely to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing?

Options:
A. C-reactive protein (CRP) testing
B. Local peer comparison
C. Procalcitonin testing
D. Testing for non-antibiotic-appropriate diagnoses

Answer: B. Local peer comparison.

Explanation:
The correct answer is local peer comparison because it involves evaluating and learning from the practices of other healthcare professionals in the same geographic area. This approach can help identify and address any variations in prescribing patterns, ultimately reducing the number of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions. By comparing local prescribing practices, healthcare professionals can identify areas for improvement and work together to implement evidence-based guidelines and best practices."
168,"Question: A 70-year-old man presents with 6 months of worsening shortness of breath on exertion and nocturnal coughing. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is currently taking lisinopril, simvastatin, and insulin. On examination, he appears tired but not in acute distress, with a pulse of 70/min, blood pressure of 140/85 mm Hg, and respirations of 25/min. He has crackles over both lower lung fields and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. An ECG shows T wave inversions in leads V1 to V4. Which medication is most likely to improve the patient's long-term survival?

A. Gemfibrozil: Gemfibrozil is an anti-triglyceride medication that may help improve the patient's cardiovascular risk factors, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and coughing.

B. Metoprolol: Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that is commonly used to treat heart failure and hypertension. It can help reduce the heart's workload and improve symptoms of shortness of breath, which may improve the patient's quality of life.

C. Amlodipine: Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that can help relax the blood vessels and improve blood flow to the heart, which may help reduce symptoms of shortness of breath. However, it may not directly address the patient's coughing symptoms.

D. Dobutamine: Dobutamine is a vasodilator that can help improve blood flow to the heart and reduce symptoms of shortness of breath. However, it may not directly address the patient's coughing symptoms.

Answer: B. Metoprolol."

171,"Question: A 27-year-old woman at 34 weeks of gestation presents with recurring episodes of sweating, weakness, and dizziness upon lying down. These symptoms resolve when she changes position. What is the likely underlying mechanism of this condition?

Options:
A. Aortocaval compression
B. Increase in plasma volume
C. Peripheral vasodilation
D. Renin-angiotensin system activation

Answer: A. Aortocaval compression

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sweating, weakness, and dizziness upon lying down are consistent with aortocaval compression, which occurs when the aorta and inferior vena cava (IVC) are compressed or obstructed. This can cause a decrease in blood flow to the lower extremities and lead to peripheral vasodilation, which can result in a drop in blood pressure upon changing position. The other options do not adequately explain the patient's symptoms."
172,"Question: A 67-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after he was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma. The physician recommends a chemotherapeutic regimen containing bortezomib. Which of the following best describes the effect of this drug?

Options:
A. Stabilization of tubulin polymers
B. Accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins
C. Preventing the relaxation of DNA supercoils
D. Inhibition of tyrosine kinase receptors

Answer: B. Accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins

Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that works by blocking the proteasome, a large protein complex responsible for degrading proteins in cells. By inhibiting the proteasome, bortezomib leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, which are proteins that have been modified with a ubiquitin molecule, a small protein that serves as a tag for protein degradation. The accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins can lead to cell death and is a key mechanism of action of bortezomib in treating mantle cell lymphoma."
173,"Question: A 37-year-old G2P1 woman presents to the clinic complaining of amenorrhea. She reports that she has not had a period for 2 months. A urine pregnancy test that she performed yesterday was negative. She is sexually active with her husband and uses regular contraception. Her past medical history is significant for diabetes and a dilation and curettage procedure 4 months ago for an unviable pregnancy. She denies any discharge, abnormal odor, abnormal bleeding, dysmenorrhea, or pain but endorses a 10-pound intentional weight loss over the past 3 months. A pelvic examination is unremarkable. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's presentation?

A. Extreme weight loss (A. : This is unlikely to be the primary cause of amenorrhea in this patient, as weight loss of 10 pounds over 3 months is not typically associated with a significant impact on menstrual function.)

B. Intrauterine adhesions (B. : Intrauterine adhesions, also known as Asherman's syndrome, can cause amenorrhea by obstructing the fallopian tubes and preventing ovulation. The patient's history of a previous dilation and curettage procedure, which can lead to the formation of adhesions, makes this option a likely explanation for her symptoms.)

C. Pregnancy (C. : While a negative urine pregnancy test suggests that the patient is not currently pregnant, it is possible that she may be experiencing a delayed menstrual cycle due to hormonal changes associated with early pregnancy. However, given the patient's history of amenorrhea for 2 months, this is unlikely to be the primary cause of her symptoms.)

D. Premature menopause (D. : Premature menopause, also known as premature ovarian failure, is a rare condition in which the ovaries stop functioning before the age of 40. While this can cause amenorrhea, it is unlikely to be the primary cause of amenorrhea in this patient, given her age and history of regular menstrual cycles.)

Answer: B. Intrauterine adhesions"
174,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question:

An investigator is studying the growth patterns of various fungal pathogens. Upon incubation of an isolated fungus at 25°C, light microscopy reveals branching hyphae with rosettes of conidia. However, after incubation at 37°C, the same organism exhibits smooth, white colonies with rounded, elongated cells under microscopic examination. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be caused by infection with this fungal pathogen?

A. Pityriasis versicolor
B. Candidiasis
C. Coccidioidomycosis
D. Sporotrichosis

Answer: D. Sporotrichosis"
175,"Question: A 27-year-old woman who recently emigrated from Brazil visits her physician with symptoms of fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, and mild abdominal discomfort. She has not seen a doctor in years and her immunization status is unknown. She drinks 2 alcoholic beverages on weekends and does not use illicit drugs. She is sexually active with several male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Her temperature is 38°C (99.8°F). Physical examination reveals right upper quadrant tenderness and scleral icterus. Serology confirms an acute infection with a virus that has partially double-stranded, circular DNA. Which of the following processes is most likely involved in the replication cycle of this virus?

A. Translation of viral DNA into bacterial proteins
B. Transcription of viral DNA into RNA in the cytoplasm
C. Reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA within the nucleus
D. Attachment of the virus to host ICAM-1 receptors

Answer: C. Reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA.

Explanation:

The virus in question has partially double-stranded, circular DNA, which indicates that it is a retrovirus. Retroviruses use a process called reverse transcription to replicate their genetic material. This involves the conversion of their RNA genome into DNA, which is then integrated into the host cell's genome. Therefore, option C, reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA, is the most likely process involved in the replication cycle of this virus.

Option A, translation of viral DNA into bacterial proteins, is not relevant as the virus is a retrovirus and does not have a DNA genome that can be translated into proteins.

Option B, transcription of viral DNA into RNA in the cytoplasm, is also not relevant as retroviruses replicate their genetic material through reverse transcription, not transcription.

Option D, attachment of the virus to host ICAM-1 receptors, is not a part of the replication cycle of the virus and is not a likely mechanism of infection."
176,"Question: A 2-day-old male newborn is brought to the physician because he became somnolent and felt cold after breastfeeding. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. He was born at 40 weeks' gestation and weighed 3538 g (7 lb 13 oz); he currently weighs 3311 g (7 lb 5 oz). Examination shows generalized hypotonia. Serum studies show an ammonia concentration of 150 μmol/L (N < 50 μmol/L). Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's neurological symptoms?

Options:

A. Increased succinyl-CoA concentration: This is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's neurological symptoms. Succinyl-CoA is not a known neurotransmitter or metabolite that could cause hypotonia or somnolence in newborns.

B. Increased glutamate concentration: Glutamate is a known excitatory neurotransmitter that can cause hyperexcitability and seizures in newborns. However, the serum glutamate concentration is not provided in the question, so it is impossible to determine if this is the cause of the patient's symptoms.

C. Decreased acylcarnitine concentration: Acylcarnitines are metabolites that play a role in the transport of fatty acids across mitochondrial membranes. Decreased acylcarnitine concentrations have been associated with certain metabolic disorders, but they are not typically associated with neurological symptoms in newborns.

D. Decreased γ-aminobutyric acid concentration: γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability. Decreased GABA concentrations can lead to hyperexcitability and seizures in newborns. The patient's symptoms of somnolence and hypotonia are consistent with a GABA deficiency.

Answer: D. Decreased γ-aminobutyric acid concentration. The patient's symptoms are most likely caused by a deficiency in GABA, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability."
177,"Question: A 54-year-old man presents to the emergency department after vomiting blood an hour ago. He experiences occasional episodes of vomiting blood but denies any pain during these episodes. The man appears disheveled and has slurred speech as he describes his symptoms. He is reluctant to provide further history and wants immediate treatment of his condition. Upon examination, tortuous veins are visible on his abdomen, and his sclerae have a yellow tinge. He suddenly begins vomiting copious amounts of blood and soon becomes unresponsive. His blood pressure drops to 70/40 mm Hg, and he is given 3 units of whole blood before passing away shortly after the incident. Which of the following was the most likely cause of his vomiting of blood?

A. Increased pressure in the distal esophageal vein due to increased pressure in the left gastric vein
B. Lacerations of the mucosa at the gastroesophageal junction
C. Decreased GABA activity due to downregulation of receptors
D. Inflammation of the portal tract due to a chronic viral illness

Answer: A. Increased pressure in the distal esophageal vein due to increased pressure in the left gastric vein.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of vomiting blood and abdominal tortuosity, along with his sudden loss of consciousness and low blood pressure, are consistent with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding episode. The increased pressure in the distal esophageal vein due to increased pressure in the left gastric vein is the most likely cause of the vomiting blood. This is because the left gastric vein is the main tributary of the distal esophageal vein, and any increase in pressure in the left gastric vein can lead to a backup of blood in the distal esophageal vein, resulting in vomiting. The other options are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms, as they do not take into account the specific anatomy and physiology of the GI tract."
178,"Question: A 21-year-old primigravida presents to her physician for a prenatal visit. She has a positive pregnancy test 1 week ago. The estimated gestational age is 16 weeks. She has no complaints. She has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and takes insulin for glucose control. The urine dipstick test shows 3+ glucose and negative for protein. The blood tests ordered at the last visit 1 week ago are as follows:

Fasting glucose: 110 mg/dL
HbA1c: 8.3%

Which of the following tests should be highly recommended for this patient?

A. Oral glucose tolerance test
B. Triple test
C. Serum creatinine
D. Chorionic villus sampling

Answer: B. Triple test

Explanation:

The patient's history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and the presence of 3+ glucose in her urine test suggest that she may have gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The triple test is a screening test that is highly recommended for patients with a history of GDM or diabetes mellitus during pregnancy. The triple test measures the levels of glucose, HbA1c, and uric acid in the urine, which can help diagnose GDM.

The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is another screening test that can be used to diagnose GDM, but it may not be as sensitive as the triple test, especially in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus. The serum creatinine test is a waste product that can be used to estimate kidney function, but it is not directly related to glucose metabolism and therefore is not a relevant test for this patient. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a diagnostic test that involves removing a sample of tissue from the placenta to test for genetic abnormalities, but it is not related to glucose metabolism and therefore is not a relevant test for this patient."
179,"Question: A 3550-g (7-lb 13-oz) male newborn is delivered at 37 weeks' gestation to a 28-year-old woman. Apgar scores are 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Routine neonatal screening tests show mildly elevated TSH concentrations. Ultrasonography of the neck shows a complete absence of both lobes of the thyroid gland. This patient's normal physical examination findings, despite the total absence of a thyroid gland, is best explained by which of the following mechanisms?

A. Transplacental transmission of thyroxine:
During fetal development, the fetus receives thyroxine (T4) from the mother through the placenta. This hormone is essential for fetal growth and development, especially during the third trimester. Even though the thyroid gland is absent, the fetus can still obtain sufficient amounts of T4 from the placenta, which explains why the newborn has normal physical examination findings despite the absence of a thyroid gland.

B. Presence of lingual thyroid tissue:
It is possible that the newborn may have lingual thyroid tissue, which can produce some thyroid hormones. Although rare, lingual thyroid tissue is a congenital abnormality that can occur in some individuals. This tissue can produce T4 and T3 hormones, which can help explain why the newborn has normal physical examination findings despite the absence of a thyroid gland.

C. Molecular mimicry of hCG subunit:
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy. It can bind to TSH receptors on the thyroid gland, mimicking the action of TSH and stimulating the production of T4 and T3 hormones. In some cases, the hCG subunit can also bind to TSH receptors, leading to the production of T4 and T3 hormones. This can help explain why the newborn has normal physical examination findings despite the absence of a thyroid gland.

D. Production of TSH-receptor antibodies:
TSH-receptor antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that can bind to TSH receptors on the thyroid gland. These antibodies can stimulate the production of T4 and T3 hormones, even in the absence of a functional thyroid gland. This can help explain why the newborn has normal physical examination findings despite the absence of a thyroid gland.

In summary, the most likely explanation for the newborn's normal physical examination findings despite the absence of a thyroid gland is transplacental transmission of thyroxine."
180,"Question: A 59-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis is brought to the physician by his wife for a 1-week history of progressive abdominal distension and yellowing of the eyes. For the past month, he has been irritable, had difficulty falling asleep, become clumsy, and fallen frequently. Two months ago he underwent banding for esophageal varices after an episode of vomiting blood. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows jaundice, multiple bruises, pedal edema, gynecomastia, loss of pubic hair, and small, firm testes. There are multiple small vascular lesions on his chest and neck that blanch with pressure. His hands are erythematous and warm; there is a flexion contracture of his left 4th finger. A flapping tremor is seen on extending the forearms and wrist. Abdominal examination shows dilated veins over the anterior abdominal wall, the spleen tip is palpated 4 cm below the left costal margin, and there is shifting dullness on percussion. Which of the following physical examination findings are caused by the same underlying pathophysiology?

A. Jaundice and flapping tremor

The jaundice and flapping tremor in this case are caused by the same underlying pathophysiology of alcoholic cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by fibrosis, inflammation, and scarring, which can lead to disturbances in the brain and nervous system, including tremors. The flapping tremor in this case is likely a result of the brain damage caused by the cirrhosis.

B. Palmar erythema and gynecomastia

Palmar erythema and gynecomastia are both signs of liver disease, particularly cirrhosis. The liver is responsible for producing hormones that regulate the growth and development of the body's tissues, including the skin and breasts. When the liver is damaged, it can lead to hormonal imbalances and the development of these symptoms.

C. Caput medusae and spider angiomata

Caput medusae and spider angiomata are signs of esophageal varices, which are enlarged veins in the esophagus that can occur as a complication of cirrhosis. These veins can rupture and cause bleeding, which can lead to the jaundice and other symptoms observed in this case.

D. Testicular atrophy and abdominal distension

Testicular atrophy and abdominal distension are not related to the same underlying pathophysiology as the other options. Testicular atrophy is a sign of hypogonadism, which can occur in various conditions, including liver disease, but it is not directly related to the pathophysiology of cirrhosis. Abdominal distension can be caused by various conditions, including cirrhosis, but it is not specific to this condition."
181,"Question: A 42-year-old African American woman presents to the physician's office complaining of sudden onset chest pain. She describes the pain as sharp, non-radiating with improvement when she is sitting up and leaning forward. She denies fever, chills, or a cough, but she has had swollen hands and wrists for the past 3 weeks. Medical history is significant for chronic hypertension. She had an appendectomy at age 12. Medications include hydralazine and folic acid. Vital signs are normal except for a low-grade fever. On examination, the patient is in mild distress, especially in the supine position. The metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints are swollen and tender bilaterally. ECG shows diffuse ST elevations. Her antinuclear antibody is negative. Which of the following additional antibodies are expected to be found in this patient's serum?

A. Anti-histone antibodies: Given the patient's symptoms of swollen hands and wrists, which are consistent with histiocytic disorders, it is likely that anti-histone antibodies will be present in the patient's serum.

B. Anti-cardiolipin antibodies: The patient's history of swollen hands and wrists, as well as the presence of diffuse ST elevations on the ECG, suggest the possibility of an autoimmune disorder such as antiphospholipid syndrome, which is associated with the presence of anti-cardiolipin antibodies.

C. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies: The patient's symptoms of swollen hands and wrists, as well as the presence of diffuse ST elevations on the ECG, suggest the possibility of a connective tissue disorder such as mitochondrial myopathy, which is associated with the presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies.

D. Anti-cyclic citrullinated antibodies: The patient's symptoms of swollen hands and wrists, as well as the presence of diffuse ST elevations on the ECG, suggest the possibility of an autoimmune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis, which is associated with the presence of anti-cyclic citrullinated antibodies.

Answer: A. Anti-histone antibodies"
182,"Question: The 23-year-old man with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza A has shown improvement in symptoms two weeks later. On discharge, pulmonary examination reveals inspiratory crackles at both lung bases. Which of the following long-term complications is the patient most likely to develop?

Options:
A. Interstitial lung disease: The patient's exposure to influenza A and the development of ARDS can lead to scarring and inflammation in the lungs, which can result in interstitial lung disease. This condition can cause persistent lung inflammation and impaired lung function.
B. Spontaneous pneumothorax: The patient's lung damage from the ARDS may increase the risk of spontaneous pneumothorax, which is a collapse of a lung due to the presence of air in the pleural space.
C. Panacinar emphysema: The patient's exposure to influenza A and the development of ARDS can lead to destruction of the alveolar-capillary membrane, resulting in panacinar emphysema. This condition can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and persistent shortness of breath.
D. Asthma: The patient's exposure to influenza A and the development of ARDS can trigger an asthma attack, which can lead to chronic airway inflammation and persistent symptoms.

Answer: A. Interstitial lung disease."
183,"Question: A 47-year-old woman presents with weakness, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness. She states that her symptoms onset gradually 4 months ago and have progressively worsened. Past medical history is significant for a long history of menorrhagia secondary to uterine fibroids. Her vital signs include: temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), blood pressure 135/82 mm Hg, and pulse 97/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory test results are shown below:

Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 74 μm3
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 21 pg/cell
Reticulocyte count 0.4 %
Serum ferritin 10 ng/mL

Which of the following is a specific feature of this patient's condition?

A. Loss of proprioception
B. Bone deformities
C. Leg ulcers
D. Restless leg syndrome

Answer: D. Restless leg syndrome

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of weakness, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness, along with her low hemoglobin level and low reticulocyte count, are consistent with anemia. Restless leg syndrome is a specific feature of this patient's condition, as it is a neurological disorder characterized by an uncomfortable sensation in the legs, often described as a creeping or crawling feeling, that occurs during rest or inactivity and is relieved by movement. The patient's history of menorrhagia and low serum ferritin level also support this diagnosis. Bone deformities and leg ulcers are not relevant to this patient's condition, and loss of proprioception is not a common symptom of anemia."
184,"Question: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department with unrelenting muscle spasms for the past several hours. The patient's girlfriend states that he started having jaw spasms and soreness last night but now his neck, back, and arms are spasming. She also states that he stepped on a nail about 1 week ago. Past medical history is noncontributory. The patient's vaccination status is unknown at this time. Today, the vital signs include temperature 39.1°C (102.4°F), heart rate 115/min, blood pressure 145/110 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 10/min. On exam, the patient is in obvious discomfort, with a clenched jaw and extended neck. Labs are drawn and a basic metabolic panel comes back normal and the white blood cell (WBC) count is moderately elevated. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's symptoms?

A. A heat-labile toxin that inhibits ACh release at the NMJ - This option is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms, as heat-labile toxins do not cause muscle spasms or elevated WBC counts.

B. A toxin that disables the G-protein coupled receptor - This option is also unlikely, as G-protein coupled receptors are not involved in muscle contraction or spasms.

C. An exotoxin that cleaves SNARE proteins - This option is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Exotoxins that cleave SNARE proteins can cause muscle spasms, as they disrupt the release of acetylcholine from the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle contraction and spasms.

D. An exotoxin that causes ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 - This option is unlikely, as ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 does not cause muscle spasms or elevated WBC counts.

Therefore, the answer is: C. An exotoxin that cleaves SNARE proteins."
185,"Question: An 8-year-old child with ""elfin"" facial features is very friendly with strangers. He has a history of mild mental retardation, and a hemizygous deletion on chromosome 7q11.23, that includes a portion of the elastin gene. Which of the following is most likely true in this patient?

Format:

Question: [Your questions]
Options: [Your options]
Answer: [Your answer]

In this case, the answer is:

C. Symptoms may develop secondary to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

Explanation:

The patient's history of mild mental retardation and hemizygous deletion on chromosome 7q11.23, which includes a portion of the elastin gene, suggests that they may be at risk for developing symptoms related to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. This is a condition where the obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract, which is the blood vessel that carries blood away from the left ventricle of the heart, can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. This is a possible complication of the hemizygous deletion and may be more likely to occur in this patient compared to the other options."
186,"Question: A 41-year-old man presents with a 7-month history of sleep disturbances, restlessness, and difficulty achieving erections. He began a new job as a project coordinator 8 months ago, which has caused significant stress and anxiety. He experiences difficulty falling asleep, lies awake worrying about his family, work, and finances, and struggles to concentrate at work. He feels tense most days and avoids socializing with friends. He fears he has an underlying medical condition causing his symptoms. Previous evaluations were unremarkable. He has a history of excessive alcohol consumption in his early 20s, but has not consumed alcohol for the past 10 years. He appears anxious. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities. Which of the following medications is most appropriate for this patient's treatment?

A. Escitalopram: A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that can help alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety.
B. Clonazepam: A benzodiazepine that can help reduce anxiety and promote relaxation, but may be associated with dependence and addiction.
C. Amitriptyline: A tricyclic antidepressant that can help alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety, but may cause sedation and weight gain.
D. Buspirone: A serotonin modulator that can help alleviate symptoms of anxiety, but may take several weeks to show effect.

Answer: D. Buspirone. Buspirone is a serotonin modulator that is commonly used to treat anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It works by increasing the amount of serotonin in the brain, which can help reduce symptoms of anxiety. While it may take several weeks to show effect, buspirone is generally well-tolerated and has a relatively low risk of dependence or addiction compared to benzodiazepines like clonazepam."
187,"Question: A new study shows a significant association between patients with a BMI >40 and a diagnosis of diabetes (odds ratio: 7.37; 95% CI 6.39-8.50). Which of the following hypothetical studies most likely yielded these results?

A. Study consisting of 500 patients with diabetes and 500 patients without diabetes comparing BMI of subjects in both groups.

B. Study consisting of 1000 genetically similar mice; 500 randomized to diet to maintain normal weight and 500 randomized to high caloric intake with the outcome of diabetes rates in both groups after 1 year.

C. Study of 1000 patients with BMI > 40 with diabetes; 500 randomized to inpatient diet and exercise with goal BMI <25, and 500 randomized to no treatment with an outcome of glycemic control without medication after 1 year.

D. Study of 1000 patients comparing rates of diabetes diagnoses and BMIs of diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Answer: A. Study consisting of 500 patients with diabetes and 500 patients without diabetes comparing BMI of subjects in both groups.

Explanation:

The correct answer is option A because the study design most closely matches the one described in the passage. The study consisted of comparing the BMI of patients with diabetes (500) and patients without diabetes (500), which is a cross-sectional design that allows for the examination of the association between two groups. The other options are not as relevant to the passage because they involve different study designs, such as a randomized controlled trial (B) or a cohort study (C), or they do not match the sample size or population characteristics mentioned in the passage (D)."
188,"Question: A 43-year-old man presents to the physician with anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and a 4.6-kg (10-lb) weight loss over the past 4 weeks, along with diaphoresis. His vital signs are: pulse: 100/min, respirations: 18/min, blood pressure: 150/78 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals warm, moist skin, goiter, and a resting tremor in both hands. Laboratory tests show a T4 concentration of 30 μg/dL and a TSH concentration of 0.1 μU/mL. The patient is started on methimazole and atenolol. Atenolol primarily affects:

A. Atrioventricular node activity
B. Vagal tone
C. Effective refractory period of the cardiac action potential
D. Phase 0 depolarization slope of the cardiac action potential

Answer: A. Atrioventricular node activity

Explanation: Atenolol is a beta-blocker that primarily affects the atrioventricular node, which is responsible for controlling the heart rate. By blocking beta receptors in the atrioventricular node, atenolol slows down the heart rate and reduces the force of contraction, which can help manage symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as tachycardia and tremors."
189,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

190,"Question: The 57-year-old woman presents with a 2-month history of intermittent dyspnea and dizziness, and a history of mitral valve stenosis. Her pulse is irregularly irregular at 125 beats per minute, and her blood pressure is 102/66 mm Hg. A transthoracic echocardiogram shows doming of the anterior mitral valve leaflet during systole. Which of the following elements is most likely to be absent from this patient's jugular venous pressure waveform?

Options:

A. Area 1: The absence of a diastolic wave in the jugular venous pressure waveform, indicating a significant left atrial pressure.
B. Area 3: A small, high-amplitude wave in the jugular venous pressure waveform, indicating a patent foramen ovale.
C. Area 4: A large, low-amplitude wave in the jugular venous pressure waveform, indicating a significant right atrial pressure.
D. Area 5: The presence of a prominent P2 wave in the jugular venous pressure waveform, indicating a patent pulmonary vein.

Answer: A. Area 1. The absence of a diastolic wave in the jugular venous pressure waveform is most likely in this patient, given the mitral valve stenosis and doming of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, which can lead to increased left atrial pressure and a decrease in the diastolic pressure wave."
191,"Question: A 60-year-old woman presents with progressive difficulty swallowing solid foods for the past 2 months. She also says her voice has gradually changed, and she has had recent episodes of vertigo associated with nausea and vomiting and oscillating eye movements while reading. She denies any problems with the movement of her face or extremities. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, managed with enalapril, and dyslipidemia, which she is managing with dietary modifications. The patient reports a 40-pack-year smoking history. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, there is decreased pain and temperature sensation on the right side of her body, and she cannot touch her nose with her eyes closed. Which of the following is the most likely site of vascular occlusion in this patient?

Options:

A. Anterior spinal artery - This artery supplies blood to the spinal cord and is not likely to be involved in vascular occlusion causing symptoms in the patient's presentation.

B. Middle cerebral artery - This artery supplies blood to the temporal and parietal lobes, which are not typically involved in vascular occlusion causing vertigo, nausea, and oscillopsia.

C. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery - This artery supplies blood to the cerebellum, and vascular occlusion in this area can cause vertigo, nausea, and oscillopsia, as well as ataxia and dysmetria. Therefore, this option is a possible cause of the patient's symptoms.

D. Posterior inferior cerebellar artery - This artery supplies blood to the cerebellum, and vascular occlusion in this area can cause similar symptoms to those listed for option C. Additionally, the patient's decreased pain and temperature sensation on the right side of her body may be related to the occlusion of this artery.

Answer: D. Posterior inferior cerebellar artery."
192,"Question: A 62-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after briefly losing consciousness while walking her dog. She spontaneously regained consciousness 20 seconds later. She has a history of atrial fibrillation. Current medications include metoprolol. She reports that she forgot to take her medication the day before and took double the dose this morning instead. A decrease in which of the following most likely contributed to this patient's episode?

Options:

A. Phosphorylation of myosin light chains in vascular smooth muscle cells
B. Activity of protein kinase C in cardiomyocytes
C. Activity of adenylyl cyclase in cardiomyocytes
D. Diastolic efflux of calcium in cardiomyocytes

Answer: C. Activity of adenylyl cyclase in cardiomyocytes

Explanation:

The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and her recent forgetfulness and double dose of metoprolol suggest that an arrhythmia may have contributed to her episode. Adenylyl cyclase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cardiac contraction and relaxation. An increase in adenylyl cyclase activity can lead to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which can cause an increase in the activity of ion channels and an increase in the excitability of cardiomyocytes. This can increase the likelihood of an arrhythmia occurring, especially in a patient with a history of atrial fibrillation. Therefore, option C is the best answer."
193,"Question: A 53-year-old white man presents to the emergency department with persistent fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, and a sensation of his heart racing for the past two weeks. He has a history of high blood pressure, which he has been managing with hydrochlorothiazide for the past eight years. He denies any history of drug abuse or smoking, but he drinks alcohol socially. His blood pressure is 145/55 mmHg, his radial pulse is 90 beats per minute and is bounding, and his temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F). On physical examination, an early diastolic murmur is audible over the left sternal border. His chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly, and echocardiography reveals chronic, severe aortic regurgitation. If left untreated, what is the most likely long-term complication for this patient's condition?

A. Arrhythmias
B. Congestive heart failure
C. Infective endocarditis
D. Sudden death

Answer: B. Congestive heart failure

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, and a sensation of his heart racing are all indicative of congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's echocardiography results, which show chronic, severe aortic regurgitation, further support this diagnosis. CHF is a common complication of aortic regurgitation, and if left untreated, it can lead to severe consequences, including reduced quality of life, decreased exercise tolerance, and increased risk of mortality. While arrhythmias, infective endocarditis, and sudden death are also potential complications, CHF is the most likely long-term complication for this patient's condition."
194,"Question: A 51-year-old man is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for a rapidly progressive newly-diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia. On day 4 of his hospitalization, the patient is noted to be obtunded. Other than the chemotherapy, he is receiving lansoprazole, acetaminophen, and an infusion of D5–0.9% normal saline at 50 mL/h. On examination, the patient’s blood pressure is 94/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 52/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. The patient appears weak but is in no acute distress. Chest auscultation reveals bibasilar crackles and scattered wheezing. His abdomen is soft, non-distended, and with a palpable liver and spleen. His ECG shows peaked T waves and widened QRS complexes. What is the best next step in the management of this patient?

A. Glucagon: Glucagon is a hormone that helps to increase blood sugar levels, but it is not the best next step in the management of this patient. The patient is already receiving lansoprazole, which is an acid-reducing medication, and glucagon would not be necessary at this time.

B. Subcutaneous regular insulin: Insulin is a hormone that helps to lower blood sugar levels, but the patient is not experiencing low blood sugar. Therefore, subcutaneous regular insulin is not the best next step in the management of this patient.

C. Polystyrene sulfonate: Polystyrene sulfonate is a medication that is used to treat constipation, but it is not the best next step in the management of this patient. The patient is not experiencing constipation, and polystyrene sulfonate would not be necessary at this time.

D. Calcium chloride: Calcium chloride is a medication that is used to treat hypocalcemia, or low calcium levels, but the patient's calcium levels are within normal range. Therefore, calcium chloride is not the best next step in the management of this patient.

Answer: D. Calcium chloride."
195,"Question: A 23-year-old woman experiences progressively worsening, throbbing pain in the back of her head two days after spontaneous delivery, with radiation to the neck and shoulder area, nausea, and one episode of clear emesis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A. Send coagulation panel - This option is not the most appropriate next step in management as the patient's symptoms do not suggest a bleeding disorder or coagulopathy.

B. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis - This option is not relevant to the patient's symptoms as there is no evidence of meningitis or other central nervous system (CNS) infection.

C. Continued bed rest - While bed rest may provide some comfort to the patient, it is not a definitive treatment for postpartum headache or neck stiffness.

D. Epidural blood injection - This option is the most appropriate next step in management as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a postpartum headache, which can be caused by epidural injection-related complications such as hematoma or infection. An epidural blood injection can help to identify any bleeding or infection in the epidural space.

Answer: D. Epidural blood injection."
196,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 34-year-old G3P3 woman presents with several weeks of headaches that are unlike her usual migraines and worsen in the morning. She also experiences emesis and right-sided weakness, which she believes is related to a new exercise routine. Her mother is a breast cancer survivor. Her medications include oral contraceptives and ibuprofen as needed, which has not helped her current headaches. She drinks 2-3 alcoholic drinks on the weekends and does not smoke. Physical examination reveals bilateral papilledema and notable upper and lower extremity strength deficits on the right side. Magnetic resonance venography shows absent flow in the left venous sinuses. Which of the following factors is most likely to have predisposed this patient to her current condition?

A. History of migraines
B. Alcohol use
C. Ibuprofen use
D. Oral contraceptive use

Answer: D. Oral contraceptive use"
197,"Question: A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of 4 episodes of vomiting that occurred that morning. The parents report that the vomit was yellowish-green with no blood in it. The patient was born at 38 weeks' gestation via vaginal delivery and has generally been healthy. He has passed normal stools each day. There is no family history of serious illness. He appears irritable and pale. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 146/min, and blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg. Examination shows a soft, mildly distended abdomen with no masses or organomegaly. A nasogastric tube is inserted and intravenous fluid resuscitation is initiated. An x-ray shows no gas distal to the duodenum. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Laparoscopy
B. Upper gastrointestinal contrast series
C. Emergent exploratory laparotomy
D. Flexible sigmoidoscopy

Answer: B. Upper gastrointestinal contrast series

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of vomiting and abdominal distension are consistent with a possible gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction or malrotation. An upper gastrointestinal contrast series can help to evaluate the patency of the GI tract and identify any obstruction or dilatation. This is the most appropriate next step in management to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms and guide further treatment. Laparoscopy, emergent exploratory laparotomy, and flexible sigmoidoscopy are not necessary at this time and may be considered if the results of the upper gastrointestinal contrast series are inconclusive or if the patient's condition worsens."
198,"Question: A 2-year-old boy is brought to a pediatrician because his parents have noticed that he seems to be getting tired very easily at home. Specifically, they have noticed that he is often panting for breath after walking around the house for a few minutes and that he needs to take naps fairly often throughout the day. He has otherwise been well, and his parents do not recall any recent infections. He was born at home, and his mom did not receive any prenatal care prior to birth. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched, harsh, holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. No cyanosis is observed. Which of the following oxygen tension profiles would most likely be seen in this patient?

A. LV (left ventricle): decreased, RV (right ventricle): normal, SC (systemic circulation): decreased
B. LV: normal, RV: increased, SC: normal
C. LV: normal, RV: normal, SC: decreased
D. LV: normal, RV: normal, SC: normal

Answer: B. LV: normal, RV: increased, SC: normal

Explanation:

The patient's high-pitched, harsh, holosystolic murmur suggests that there may be a problem with the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Specifically, the murmur is located at the lower left sternal border, which suggests that the murmur is coming from the left ventricle. The fact that the patient is tiring easily and needs to take naps frequently suggests that the left ventricle may be underperforming, leading to decreased cardiac output and decreased oxygen delivery to the body.

However, the physical exam does not reveal any signs of cyanosis, which suggests that the right ventricle is not significantly affected. Therefore, the most likely oxygen tension profile in this patient is one in which the left ventricle is increased, but the right ventricle and systemic circulation are normal. This is consistent with the diagnosis of a left-sided heart murmur, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, or valvular heart disease."
199,"Question: A 37-year-old nulliparous woman presents to the physician with a 6-month history of heavy, prolonged menstrual bleeding, dyspareunia, and cyclical abdominal pain. Her menstrual history indicates that menses previously occurred at regular 28-day intervals and lasted 4 days with normal flow. During pelvic examination, an asymmetrically enlarged, nodular uterus consistent in size with a 10-week gestation is noted. A urine pregnancy test is negative. A photomicrograph of a section of an endometrial biopsy specimen is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Endometrial hyperplasia - This condition is characterized by excessive growth of the endometrium, which can lead to abnormal bleeding and other symptoms. However, the photomicrograph of the endometrial biopsy specimen does not show the characteristic features of endometrial hyperplasia, such as excessive proliferation of the endometrial glands and stroma.

B. Endometriosis - This condition occurs when tissue similar to the endometrium grows outside of the uterus, leading to inflammation, pain, and irregular bleeding. The nodular uterus on pelvic examination and the presence of abdominal pain suggest the possibility of endometriosis, but the photomicrograph of the endometrial biopsy specimen does not show the characteristic features of endometriosis, such as glandular and stromal tissue outside of the uterus.

C. Leiomyoma - This is a benign tumor of the uterus that can cause irregular bleeding and pelvic pain. The nodular uterus on pelvic examination and the presence of abdominal pain are consistent with the diagnosis of leiomyoma. The photomicrograph of the endometrial biopsy specimen shows a smooth muscle tumor with a characteristic ""spindle"" shape, which is consistent with a leiomyoma.

D. Adenomyosis - This is a condition in which tissue similar to the endometrium grows into the myometrium, leading to abnormal bleeding and pelvic pain. The nodular uterus on pelvic examination and the presence of abdominal pain suggest the possibility of adenomyosis, but the photomicrograph of the endometrial biopsy specimen does not show the characteristic features of adenomyosis, such as endometrial glands and stroma invading the myometrium.

Answer: C. Leiomyoma."
200,"Question: A 30-year-old man with a BMI of 33.7 kg/m2 presents with severe pain in his right toe that began this morning. He had a few beers last night at a friend’s party but otherwise has had no recent dietary changes. On examination, the right toe appears swollen, warm, red, and tender to touch. Joint aspiration is performed. What will examination of the fluid most likely reveal?

Options:
A. Increased glucose
B. Needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals on polarized light
C. Rhomboid-shaped, positively birefringent crystals on polarized light
D. Anti-CCP antibodies

Answer: B. Needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals on polarized light.

Explanation: The fluid aspirated from the patient's swollen and tender right toe is likely to reveal needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals on polarized light. This is a classic finding in the diagnosis of gout, a type of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints. The presence of these crystals in the fluid indicates that the patient is experiencing an acute gout attack."
201,"Question: The 19-year-old man presents to the clinic with a recent onset skin rash on his back. He has no known medical history and denies any recent travel or exposure to new medications. On examination, numerous hypopigmented skin lesions are noted on his upper back. When questioned, he reveals that these lesions do not darken after exposure to sunlight. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Tinea versicolor - This is a common fungal infection that can cause hypopigmented patches on the skin. It is often seen in young adults and is more common in warm, humid climates.
B. Mycosis fungoides - This is a rare, slow-growing cancer of the skin that can cause hypopigmented patches. It is more common in older adults and is often associated with a history of exposure to sunlight.
C. Pityriasis rosea - This is a common skin condition that can cause a hypopigmented patch on the skin, often with a characteristic ""herald patch"" on the chest or abdomen. It is usually not associated with a history of recent travel or exposure to new medications.
D. Secondary syphilis - This is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause a skin rash, often with hypopigmented patches, on the body. It is more common in young adults and is often associated with a history of recent sexual exposure.

Answer: A. Tinea versicolor"
202,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 31-year-old man visits the doctor due to severe muscle pain and fever that has lasted for 4 days. He enjoys hunting and consumed bear meat a month ago. Examination reveals periorbital edema and generalized muscle tenderness. His white blood cell count is 12,000/mm3 with 19% eosinophils. The release of major basic protein in response to this patient's infection is most likely caused by which of the following?

Options:
A. Th1 cells and macrophages interacting with each other
B. An increase in the expression of MHC class I molecules
C. An increase in the expression of MHC class II molecules
D. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity

Answer: D. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity"
203,"Question: A 47-year-old man presents to the emergency department with urinary and fecal incontinence lasting 6 hours after a fall at a construction site. He took ibuprofen for lower back pain earlier in the day. His vital signs are: temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse 80/min, blood pressure 132/84 mm Hg. Examination reveals tenderness over the lumbar spine, bilateral lower extremity weakness, absent ankle jerk reflexes, and preserved patellar reflexes. There is decreased rectal tone. An ultrasound of the bladder shows a full bladder. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Spinal epidural abscess
B. Cerebellar stroke
C. Conus medullaris syndrome
D. Anterior spinal cord syndrome

Answer: C. Conus medullaris syndrome

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of urinary and fecal incontinence, along with the examination findings of tenderness over the lumbar spine, bilateral lower extremity weakness, absent ankle jerk reflexes, and decreased rectal tone, are consistent with Conus medullaris syndrome. This condition is caused by compression of the conus medullaris, the terminal part of the spinal cord, typically due to a herniated intervertebral disc. The patient's recent fall and the presence of lower back pain also support this diagnosis. While spinal epidural abscess, cerebellar stroke, and anterior spinal cord syndrome can also cause similar symptoms, the patient's presentation and examination findings are more consistent with Conus medullaris syndrome."
204,"Question: A 45-year-old man presents with a 1-day history of progressive pain and blurred vision in his right eye, along with difficulty opening the eye due to pain. His left eye is asymptomatic. He wears contact lenses and has a history of bronchial asthma treated with inhaled salbutamol. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg. Examination reveals a visual acuity of 20/25 in his left eye and the ability to count fingers at 3 feet in his right eye. A photograph of his right eye is provided. Based on the information given, the most likely diagnosis is:

A. Staphylococcus aureus keratitis
B. Pseudomonas keratitis
C. Angle-closure glaucoma
D. Herpes zoster keratitis

Answer: B. Pseudomonas keratitis

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of progressive pain and blurred vision in his right eye, along with difficulty opening the eye due to pain, are consistent with Pseudomonas keratitis. The patient's history of contact lens use and bronchial asthma also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. Pseudomonas keratitis is a bacterial infection that can cause pain, redness, and blurred vision in the affected eye, and is more common in contact lens users. The other options are less likely given the patient's symptoms and medical history."
205,"Question: A 28-year-old primigravid woman presents to the physician at 27 weeks' gestation with symptoms of increased urinary frequency, burning sensation during urination, flank pain, and nausea. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated until now. Glucose tolerance testing performed at 25 weeks' gestation was normal. She is sexually active with her husband and takes a prenatal vitamin. Her vital signs are: pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 125/75 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals marked tenderness in the right costovertebral area, and pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent with 27 weeks' gestation. Urine dipstick is positive for leukocyte esterase and nitrites, and a urine culture is sent for further evaluation. Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, which of the following is the most likely cause of her condition?

A. Decreased ureteral smooth muscle tone
B. Increased body temperature
C. Decreased urine volume
D. Increased urinary pH

Answer: A. Decreased ureteral smooth muscle tone

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of increased urinary frequency, burning sensation during urination, and flank pain are consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI). The tenderness in the right costovertebral area suggests a possible kidney infection. The positive urine dipstick for leukocyte esterase and nitrites also supports this diagnosis. Decreased ureteral smooth muscle tone can lead to a backup of urine in the kidneys, which can cause bacterial growth and infection. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause of the patient's condition."
206,"Question: A 57-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was the back seat restrained passenger in a vehicle that was rear ended at 25 miles/hour. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 97/68 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient is subsequently worked up with a chest radiograph, ECG, FAST exam, and serum chemistries. A cardiac catheterization reveals equilibration in diastolic pressure across all cardiac chambers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Congestive heart failure: Given the patient's history of hypertension and COPD, as well as the equilibration in diastolic pressure across all cardiac chambers seen on cardiac catheterization, it is possible that the patient may be experiencing congestive heart failure. However, the patient's normal oxygen saturation and normal respiratory rate suggest that this is unlikely to be the primary diagnosis.

B. Septic shock: The patient's normal temperature and normal oxygen saturation suggest that sepsis is unlikely to be the primary diagnosis. However, the patient's history of diabetes and COPD do increase the likelihood of sepsis.

C. Tamponade: The patient's normal oxygen saturation and normal respiratory rate, along with the equilibration in diastolic pressure across all cardiac chambers seen on cardiac catheterization, suggest that tamponade is the most likely diagnosis. Tamponade occurs when blood accumulates in the pericardial space, compressing the heart and impairing its ability to function properly.

D. Tension pneumothorax: The patient's normal oxygen saturation and normal respiratory rate, along with the equilibration in diastolic pressure across all cardiac chambers seen on cardiac catheterization, suggest that tension pneumothorax is unlikely to be the primary diagnosis.

Answer: C. Tamponade."
207,"Question: A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother due to concerns about his behavior. The mother reports that her son no longer listens to her and has difficulty concentrating on tasks for extended periods. Teachers at his preschool have also noticed that he is more active and disruptive than other children, often interrupting or bothering them. The patient was expelled from another preschool for hitting his teacher and classmates, and has a history of acute otitis media. He has met all developmental milestones and appears healthy and well-nourished. During the examination, the patient does not seem to respond when spoken to directly. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?

Options:

A. Behavior therapy: This is the most appropriate next step in treatment. The patient's behavioral issues, such as not listening and difficulty concentrating, suggest that he may have a behavioral disorder such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Behavior therapy can help the patient learn to manage his behavior and improve his ability to focus and pay attention.

B. Methimazole: This option is incorrect as methimazole is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, not a behavioral disorder.

C. Fluoxetine: This option is incorrect as fluoxetine is an antidepressant medication, not a treatment for behavioral disorders.

D. Hearing aids: This option is incorrect as there is no indication in the patient's symptoms that he has any hearing problems.

Answer: A. Behavior therapy."
208,"Question: A 76-year-old female is brought to the emergency department after being found unresponsive in her room at her nursing facility. Past medical history is significant for Alzheimer's disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Surgical history is notable for an open cholecystectomy at age 38 and multiple cesarean sections. On arrival, she is non-responsive but breathing by herself, and her vital signs are T 102.9 F, HR 123 bpm, BP 95/64, RR 26/min, and SaO2 97% on 6L nasal cannula. On physical exam the patient has marked abdominal distension and is tympanic to percussion. Laboratory studies are notable for a lactic acidosis. An upright abdominal radiograph and CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast are shown in Figures A and B respectively. She is started on IV fluids and a nasogastric tube is placed to suction which returns green bilious fluid. Repeat vitals 1 hour later are T 101F, HR 140 bpm, BP 75/44, RR 30/min, and SaO2 is 100% on the ventilator after she is intubated for airway concerns. What is the next best step in management?

A. Therapy with levofloxacin and metronidazole - Incorrect. While antibiotics may be considered in the management of a patient with suspected perforated viscus, it is not the next best step in this scenario as the patient's abdominal distension and tympanic to percussion suggests a more urgent surgical intervention is needed.

B. Immediate laparotomy and surgical management - Correct. The patient's presentation of abdominal distension, tympanic to percussion, and lactic acidosis suggests a possible perforated viscus, which is a surgical emergency. Immediate laparotomy and surgical management is the next best step in management to address the perforation and prevent further complications.

C. Pneumatic enema - Incorrect. A pneumatic enema is not a suitable intervention for a patient with a suspected perforated viscus. It may be considered in some cases of intestinal obstruction or bowel ischemia, but not in this scenario where the patient has signs of peritonitis and perforation.

D. Sigmoidoscopy, attempted derotation and rectal tube placement - Incorrect. While sigmoidoscopy may be considered in some cases of suspected intestinal obstruction or perforation, it is not the next best step in management for this patient. The patient's abdominal distension and tympanic to percussion suggest a more urgent surgical intervention is needed, and laparotomy is the most appropriate next step."
209,"Question: A 68-year-old woman presents to the physician for evaluation of diminished vision that has been present for several months. Twenty-eight years ago, she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, which has been well controlled with hydroxychloroquine. Fundoscopic examination reveals concentric rings of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation surrounding the fovea bilaterally. What is the most likely outcome of the visual field examination in this patient?

Options:

A. Bitemporal hemianopia - This is a condition where there is a loss of vision in the upper and lower halves of both visual fields, typically due to damage to the temporal lobes of the brain.

B. Right monocular blindness - This is a condition where there is a loss of vision in one eye, typically due to damage to the retina or optic nerve.

C. Paracentral scotoma - A scotoma is a blind spot in the visual field, and a paracentral scotoma is a blind spot located in the center of the visual field. This can be caused by damage to the retina or optic nerve.

D. Binasal hemianopia - This is a condition where there is a loss of vision in the upper and lower halves of both visual fields, typically due to damage to the temporal lobes of the brain.

Answer: C. Paracentral scotoma. The concentric rings of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation seen on fundoscopic examination are consistent with a paracentral scotoma, which is the most likely outcome of the visual field examination in this patient."
210,"Question: The drug cilostazol is known for its ability to relax vascular smooth muscle and cause vasodilation through its inhibition of phosphodiesterase 3. Given this mechanism of action, what other effect would be expected?

Options:
A. Increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume
B. Positive inotropy
C. Angioedema
D. Antiarrhythmic action

Answer: B. Positive inotropy

Explanation: Cilostazol's ability to relax vascular smooth muscle and cause vasodilation through the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 3 leads to an increase in blood flow and oxygen delivery to the heart muscle, resulting in positive inotropy. This means that the heart muscle contracts stronger and more efficiently, leading to improved cardiac function. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
211,"Question: A 31-year-old female is diagnosed with a bacterial infection and is prescribed a drug that binds the dipeptide D-Ala-D-Ala. Which of the following drugs was this patient prescribed?

Options:
A. Penicillin

212,"Question: A 5-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric clinic for evaluation of fever, pain, swelling in the left leg, and limping. Review of systems and history is otherwise unremarkable. The vital signs include: pulse 110/min, temperature 38.1°C (100.6°F), and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. On examination, there is a tender swelling over the lower part of his left leg. Which 1 of the following X-ray findings is most suggestive of Ewing's sarcoma?

Options:

A. Mixed lytic and blastic appearance in the X-ray
B. X-ray showing lytic bone lesion with periosteal reaction
C. X-ray showing broad-based projections from the surface of the bone
D. X-ray showing deep muscle plane displacement from the metaphysis

Answer: B. X-ray showing lytic bone lesion with periosteal reaction

Rationale: Ewing's sarcoma typically presents with a lytic bone lesion with a periosteal reaction, which is characterized by the protrusion of bone into the soft tissue. The broad-based projections from the surface of the bone (Option C) and deep muscle plane displacement from the metaphysis (Option D) are not typical features of Ewing's sarcoma. Mixed lytic and blastic appearance in the X-ray (Option A) is also not specific to Ewing's sarcoma and can be seen in other bone tumors."
213,"Question: A 25-year-old man is rushed to the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident. After an initial evaluation, he is found to have bilateral femoral fractures. After surgical fixation of his fractures, he suddenly starts to feel nauseated and becomes agitated. Past medical history is significant for a thyroid disorder. His temperature is 40.0°C (104°F), blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg, pulse is 170/min and irregularly irregular, and respirations are 20/min. On physical examination, the patient is confused and delirious. Oriented x 0. Laboratory studies are significant for the following:

Thyroxine (T4), free 5 ng/dL
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.001 mU/L

The patient is started on propranolol to control his current symptoms. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of this new medication?

A. Inhibition of thyroid peroxidase enzyme
B. Inhibition of an underlying autoimmune process
C. Decrease the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3
D. Interference with enterohepatic circulation and recycling of thyroid hormones

Answer: C. Decrease the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3

Explanation: Propranolol, a beta-blocker, works by blocking the conversion of T4 to T3 in the periphery. T4 is the inactive form of thyroid hormone, and T3 is the active form. Propranolol decreases the conversion of T4 to T3, resulting in a decrease in the levels of active T3 in the body. This can help to control symptoms such as agitation, nausea, and confusion, which are commonly seen in hyperthyroidism."
214,"Question: A 52-year-old tow truck driver presents to the emergency room in the middle of the night complaining of sudden onset right ankle pain. He states that the pain came on suddenly and woke him up from sleep. It was so severe that he had to call an ambulance to bring him to the hospital since he was unable to drive. He has a history of hypertension and types 2 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes lisinopril and methotrexate. He has no other medical problems. The family history is notable for hypertension on his father’s side. The vital signs include: blood pressure 126/86 mm Hg, heart rate 84/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F). On physical exam, the patient’s right ankle is swollen, erythematous, exquisitely painful, and warm to the touch. An arthrocentesis is performed and shows negatively birefringent crystals on polarized light. Which of the following is the best choice for treating this patient’s pain?

A. Administer probenecid: Probenecid is a medication that is used to treat gout flares, but it is not the best choice for treating ankle pain in this patient. Probenecid works by increasing the excretion of uric acid in the urine, but the patient's arthrocentesis results show the presence of negatively birefringent crystals, which are a sign of calcium pyelonephritis, not gout.

B. Administer colchicine: Colchicine is a medication that is used to treat gout flares, and it is the best choice for treating ankle pain in this patient. Colchicine works by reducing inflammation and preventing the formation of crystals in the joints.

C. Administer indomethacin: Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to treat pain and inflammation. While it may be effective in reducing the patient's ankle pain, it is not the best choice for treating the underlying cause of the pain, which is calcium pyelonephritis.

D. Administer febuxostat: Febuxostat is a medication that is used to treat gout flares, but it is not the best choice for treating ankle pain in this patient. Febuxostat works by inhibiting the production of uric acid in the body, but the patient's arthrocentesis results show the presence of negatively birefringent crystals, which are a sign of calcium pyelonephritis, not gout.

Answer: C. Administer indomethacin."
215,"Question: A 16-month-old girl presents for a routine examination. The patient’s mother reports that the child is craving ice and often gasps for breath while walking or playing. Family history is unremarkable. The patient is afebrile, and vital signs are within normal limits. Her weight is at the 20th percentile and height is at the 35th percentile for age and sex. Conjunctival pallor is noted on physical examination. Laboratory findings are significant for:

Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume: 72 μm3
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin: 21 pg/cell
Serum ferritin: 9 ng/mL
Red cell distribution width: 16% (ref: 11.5–14.5%)

Which of the following additional laboratory findings would most likely be found in this patient?

A. ↑ Transferrin saturation
B. ↑ Total iron binding capacity (TIBC)
C. ↑ Reticulocyte count
D. ↑ Hemoglobin A2

Answer: B. ↑ Total iron binding capacity (TIBC)

Explanation:
The patient's laboratory findings suggest that she has iron deficiency anemia, as evidenced by a low serum ferritin level and a high red cell distribution width. Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) is a measure of the total amount of iron binding proteins in the blood, including transferrin and lactoferrin. Since the patient has iron deficiency anemia, it is likely that her TIBC level will be elevated.

Option A, ↑ transferrin saturation, is not the correct answer as transferrin saturation is not a reliable marker of iron deficiency anemia. Transferrin saturation is the percentage of transferrin proteins that are bound to iron, and it can be affected by other factors such as inflammation or liver disease.

Option C, ↑ reticulocyte count, is also not the correct answer as reticulocyte count is not a reliable marker of iron deficiency anemia. Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells that are produced in response to anemia, but they are not a direct measure of iron status.

Option D, ↑ hemoglobin A2, is not the correct answer as hemoglobin A2 is not a reliable marker of iron deficiency anemia. Hemoglobin A2 is a variant of hemoglobin that is produced in response to anemia, but it is not a direct measure of iron status."

CRP: 28 mg/dL (Normal: < 3 mg/dL)
Amylase: 582 U/L (Normal: 23-85 U/L)
Lipase: 1,415 U/L (Normal: 0-160 U/L)

What is the best medication for this patient in the long-term following initial stabilization?

A. Aspirin: Aspirin is an antiplatelet medication that is commonly used to prevent heart attacks and strokes. However, in this case, the patient's elevated CRP level and amylase and lipase levels suggest that there may be an underlying pancreatitis or biliary disease, which could be exacerbated by aspirin. Therefore, aspirin may not be the best medication choice for this patient in the long term.

B. Atorvastatin: Atorvastatin is a statin medication that is used to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. While it may be beneficial for this patient's elevated cholesterol levels, it may not address the underlying cause of the patient's chest pain and vomiting.

C. Gemfibrozil: Gemfibrozil is a fibrate medication that is used to lower triglyceride levels and improve lipid profiles. In this case, the patient's elevated triglyceride levels and pancreatitis symptoms suggest that gemfibrozil may be a good medication choice to reduce the risk of pancreatitis and improve lipid profiles.

D. Niacin: Niacin is a B-complex vitamin that is used to raise HDL cholesterol levels and improve lipid profiles. While it may be beneficial for this patient's elevated cholesterol levels, it may not address the underlying cause of the patient's chest pain and vomiting.

Answer: C. Gemfibrozil."
217,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 24-year-old African American college student visits your office for a scheduled appointment. He has been feeling occasional discomfort in his flank, which comes and goes. He doesn't have a fever, chills, or any other symptoms. His vaccinations are up to date, and his family history is unknown since he was adopted. He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes every 3 days, drinks socially, and denies any current illicit drug use, although he has a history of injection drug use. He works as a waiter to pay for his college tuition. During the physical examination, you find a healthy young man with a lean build, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, and no signs of lower extremity edema. A urinalysis is ordered, which shows 8 red blood cells (RBCs) per high-power field (HPF) on the first test. The test is repeated several weeks later, and 6 RBCs/HPF are found. What is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A. Plain abdominal X-ray
B. Intravenous (IV) pyelogram
C. 24-hour urine collection test
D. Repeat urinalysis in 6 months

Answer: B. Intravenous (IV) pyelogram"
218,"Question: A 59-year-old woman presents with progressively worsening coordination and involuntary movements in her left hand, along with withdrawal and apathy, for the past 6 months. Her examination reveals a bimanual, rhythmic, low-frequency tremor that is more pronounced in her left hand, with normal range of motion in her arms and legs, slow active movements, and increased resistance to passive flexion and extension in her limbs. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of her symptoms?

Options:

A. Copper accumulation due to mutations in hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase
B. Neuronal degeneration due to α-synuclein protein misfolding
C. Cerebellar ischemia due to chronic hypertension
D. Proliferation of beta-adrenergic receptors from excessive circulating T4

Answer: B. Neuronal degeneration due to α-synuclein protein misfolding.

The patient's symptoms of progressive coordination and movement difficulties, along with the presence of a bimanual, rhythmic tremor, are consistent with the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The α-synuclein protein is a key component of the dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, and its misfolding and aggregation are believed to be the primary cause of Parkinson's disease. The other options are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms, given the patient's age and the presence of a tremor. Copper accumulation is not a common cause of neurodegeneration, and cerebellar ischemia is typically associated with more sudden onset of symptoms. The proliferation of beta-adrenergic receptors is not a direct cause of Parkinson's disease, although it may be a consequence of the disease process."
219,"Question: A 33-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a wellness check-up. She reports occasional headaches that improve with ibuprofen and rest. What is the most likely diagnosis based on her symptoms and laboratory results?

Options:
A. Cushing syndrome
B. Narrowing of the renal arteries
C. Pheochromocytoma
D. Primary hyperaldosteronism

Answer: D. Primary hyperaldosteronism

Explanation: The patient's history of occasional headaches that improve with ibuprofen and rest, along with her elevated aldosterone level and low renin level, are consistent with primary hyperaldosteronism. This is a condition in which the adrenal glands produce too much aldosterone, leading to high blood levels of sodium and low levels of potassium. The normal S1 and S2 sounds on cardiac exam and clear lungs with good air movement bilaterally also support this diagnosis. While Cushing syndrome, narrowing of the renal arteries, and pheochromocytoma could potentially cause some of the same symptoms, they are less likely given the patient's laboratory results and physical exam findings."
220,"Question: A 23-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after being found unresponsive by her friends. The patient is an IV drug user and her friends came over and found her passed out in her room. The patient presented to the emergency department 2 days ago after being involved in a bar fight where she broke her nose and had it treated and packed with gauze. Her temperature is 99.3°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 90/48 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 24/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an obtunded woman with nasal packing and EKG tags from her last hospital stay, as well as a purpuric rash on her arms and legs. Her arms have track marks on them and blisters. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

A. Nafcillin: Nafcillin is an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat skin infections, including those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. However, in this patient's case, the purpuric rash on her arms and legs is more likely a sign of drug-induced hypovolemia or sepsis, rather than a bacterial infection. Therefore, nafcillin is not the best next step in management.

B. Norepinephrine: Norepinephrine is a vasopressor that is used to treat hypotension in patients with septic shock. However, in this patient's case, her blood pressure is already within the normal range, so norepinephrine is not necessary.

C. Removal of nasal packing: The nasal packing is likely there to help manage the patient's recent nose injury, and removing it would not be the best next step in management.

D. Vancomycin: Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. However, the patient's rash is not consistent with a MRSA infection, so vancomycin is not the best next step in management.

Therefore, the best next step in management for this patient is to:

C. Removal of nasal packing."
221,"Question: A 60-year-old woman is brought into the office by her son, who reports that she has been exhibiting inappropriate behavior over the past few years. She has been removing her clothes in front of visitors, putting objects in her mouth, and laughing inappropriately at her friend's funeral. Despite this, she has shown no emotional response to the death of a close friend. On examination, she demonstrates some memory impairment, forgetting how to use objects such as a telephone, but has no other medical issues and takes no medications. What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Alzheimer's dementia
B. Lewy body dementia
C. Pick's disease
D. Vascular dementia

Answer: C. Pick's disease

Explanation:
The patient's behavioral symptoms, such as removing her clothes in front of visitors and putting objects in her mouth, are consistent with Pick's disease, a rare form of dementia. The lack of emotional response to the death of a close friend and the memory impairment, including forgetting how to use objects, are also consistent with Pick's disease. While Alzheimer's dementia, Lewy body dementia, and vascular dementia can also present with similar symptoms, Pick's disease is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation."
222,"Question: A 13-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents for the evaluation of progressive hair loss over the past 2 months. The parents report that they have noticed increased number of hairless patches on their daughter's head. The patient denies any itching. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. The patient states that she has been feeling tense since her boyfriend broke up with her. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She does not use illicit drugs. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows ill-defined patchy hair loss and hair of different lengths with no scaling or reddening of the scalp. Further examination shows poor hair growth of the eyebrows and eyelashes. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Scarring alopecia: This condition involves the loss of hair due to scarring of the hair follicles, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

B. Telogen effluvium: This condition is characterized by excessive hair shedding due to hormonal imbalances, which is also not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

C. Alopecia areata: This condition involves the loss of hair due to an autoimmune response, which can cause patchy hair loss. However, the patient's symptoms do not suggest this condition.

D. Trichotillomania: This is a psychological disorder characterized by the compulsive pulling of one's own hair, leading to hair loss. The patient's statement that she has been feeling tense since her boyfriend broke up with her suggests that this condition may be the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: D. Trichotillomania."
223,"Question: A 34-year-old man presents to the physician with progressive swelling of the left lower leg that has been present for 4 months. One year ago, he experienced an episode of intermittent fever and tender lymphadenopathy after returning from a trip to India, which resolved spontaneously. Physical examination reveals 4+ nonpitting edema of the left lower leg. His white blood cell count is 8,000/mm3 with 25% eosinophils. A blood smear obtained at night confirms the diagnosis. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine is initiated. Which of the following is the most likely means of transmission of the causative agent?

A. Deposition of larvae into the skin by a female black fly
B. Penetration of the skin by cercariae from contaminated fresh water
C. Deposition of thread-like larvae into the skin by a female mosquito
D. Penetration of the skin by hookworms through feces

Answer: C. Deposition of thread-like larvae into the skin by a female mosquito.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous larva migrans, which is caused by the larvae of the dog tapeworm (Dipylidium caninum). The larvae are deposited into the skin by the bite of an infected mosquito, typically the Aedes or Culex species. The patient's recent travel to India and the presence of eosinophilia in his bloodwork support the diagnosis of a tropical parasitic infection."
224,"Question: A 13-month-old girl is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. She was born at 38 weeks' gestation. There is no family history of any serious illnesses. She cannot pull herself to stand from a sitting position. She can pick an object between her thumb and index finger but cannot drink from a cup or feed herself using a spoon. She comes when called by name and is willing to play with a ball. She cries if she does not see her parents in the same room as her. She coos “ma” and “ba.” She is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination including neurologic examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of her development?

Options:
A. Fine motor: normal | Gross motor: delayed | Language: normal | Social skills: delayed
The child's difficulty in pulling herself to stand from a sitting position and her inability to drink from a cup or feed herself using a spoon suggest delayed gross motor skills. While she is able to pick up objects between her thumb and index finger, this is not a significant milestone for her age. Her willingness to play with a ball and her ability to come when called by name indicate normal language and social skills. Her cooing of ""ma"" and ""ba"" is also a normal milestone for her age. Therefore, the most appropriate assessment of her development is:

B. Fine motor: delayed | Gross motor: normal | Language: normal | Social skills: delayed

Explanation: The child's delayed gross motor skills are the most significant concern in this scenario. While she has normal fine motor skills and language development, her inability to perform age-appropriate gross motor skills warrants further evaluation and monitoring. It is important to assess the child's overall development and rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to her delayed gross motor skills."
225,"Sure! Here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 26-year-old woman visits her physician with persistent pain and swelling in her right foot that has been present for two weeks. Initially, the pain was intermittent, but it has now become constant and is rated as 8 out of 10 in intensity. She has not experienced any trauma to the foot and has no prior joint problems. The pain has hindered her ability to train for an upcoming marathon. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. As a model, she often wears stilettos for fashion shows. Her overall health appears normal. Vital signs are within normal limits. During the examination, swelling is noticed in the right forefoot, and there is tenderness to palpation over the fifth metatarsal shaft. Pushing the fifth toe inwardly causes pain. The rest of the examination reveals no abnormalities. Which of the following conditions is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Acute osteomyelitis
B. Stress fracture
C. Plantar fasciitis
D. Freiberg disease

Answer: B. Stress fracture"
226,"Question: A 4-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a nonpruritic, painless rash that has been on her face for 5 days. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:
A. Oral acyclovir therapy
B. Oral cephalexin therapy
C. Oral clindamycin therapy
D. Topical mupirocin therapy

Answer: D. Topical mupirocin therapy

Explanation:
Based on the information provided in the question, the most likely diagnosis is bullous pemphigoid, a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause a nonpruritic, painless rash on the face. Topical mupirocin therapy is the most appropriate next step in management, as it is effective in treating bullous pemphigoid and can help prevent further skin damage. Oral acyclovir, cephalexin, and clindamycin are not appropriate treatments for bullous pemphigoid, as they are not effective in managing this condition."
227,"Question: The neuroscientist discusses neuroreceptors that function as ion channels in neurons, specifically mentioning one receptor that is both voltage-gated and ligand-gated. Which of the following receptors is most likely to be the one discussed?

A. GABAA receptor: The GABAA receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that is responsible for inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. While it can also be voltage-gated, it is not the receptor mentioned in the passage as being both voltage-gated and ligand-gated.

B. Glycine receptor: The glycine receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that is involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the spinal cord and brain. It is also voltage-gated, but it is not the receptor mentioned in the passage.

C. NMDA receptor: The NMDA receptor is a voltage-gated ion channel that plays a critical role in learning and memory. It is also a ligand-gated receptor, meaning that it can be activated by certain ligands. The passage mentions a receptor that is both voltage-gated and ligand-gated, which makes the NMDA receptor a likely candidate.

D. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor: The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that is activated by acetylcholine. While it can also be voltage-gated, it is not the receptor mentioned in the passage as being both voltage-gated and ligand-gated.

Answer: C. NMDA receptor."
228,"Question: A 24-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient was at a stop when he was rear-ended from behind by a vehicle traveling at 11 miles per hour. The patient complains of severe back pain but states he otherwise feels well. The patient is currently seeing a physical therapist who is giving him exercises to alleviate the back pain that is present every morning, relieved by activity, and worse with inactivity. He is a student at the university and is struggling with his grades. His temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 117/78 mmHg, pulse is 116/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam demonstrates a decreased range of motion of the patient's spine and tenderness to palpation over the vertebrae. The rest of the exam is deferred due to pain. The patient is requesting a note to excuse him from final exams and work. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

A. Vertebral fracture:

The patient's complaint of severe back pain and decreased range of motion of the spine, along with the physical exam findings of tenderness to palpation over the vertebrae, are highly suggestive of a vertebral fracture. This is a common injury in motor vehicle accidents, especially when the patient is rear-ended at a low speed. The patient's request for a note to excuse him from final exams and work also supports this diagnosis, as a vertebral fracture can cause significant pain and disability that may interfere with the patient's ability to attend school or work.

B. Malingering:

While the patient's complaint of back pain and decreased range of motion is consistent with a vertebral fracture, the patient's request for a note to excuse him from final exams and work raises the possibility of malingering. However, the patient's temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respirations are all within normal limits, which is inconsistent with the symptoms of malingering. Additionally, the patient's history of seeing a physical therapist for back pain suggests that he may be genuinely experiencing back pain.

C. Spondylolisthesis:

Spondylolisthesis is a condition where a vertebra slips out of place, causing back pain and stiffness. However, the patient's age and the mechanism of injury (rear-ending at a low speed) do not fit the typical presentation of spondylolisthesis. Additionally, the patient's physical exam findings of tenderness to palpation over the vertebrae are more consistent with a vertebral fracture than spondylolisthesis.

D. Herniated nucleus pulposus:

A herniated nucleus pulposus is a condition where a disc in the spine bulges or ruptures, causing back pain and stiffness. However, the patient's age and the mechanism of injury (rear-ending at a low speed) do not fit the typical presentation of a herniated nucleus pulposus. Additionally, the patient's physical exam findings of tenderness to palpation over the vertebrae are more consistent with a vertebral fracture than a herniated nucleus pulposus."
229,"Question: A 78-year-old woman is brought to the emergency ward by her son for lethargy and generalized weakness. The patient speaks in short utterances and does not make eye contact with the provider or her son throughout the interview and examination. You elicit that the patient lives with her son and daughter-in-law, and she reports vague weakness for the last couple days. The emergency room provider notices 3-4 healing bruises on the patient's upper extremities; otherwise, examination is not revealing. Routine chemistries and blood counts are unremarkable; non-contrast head CT demonstrates normal age-related changes. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A. Perform lumbar puncture - This is not the most appropriate next step in management, as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a neurological condition that would benefit from a lumbar puncture.

B. Question the patient's son regarding the home situation - It is important to assess the patient's home situation and determine if there are any potential sources of abuse or neglect. Asking the patient's son to leave the room during the examination is not necessary, as the provider can gather the necessary information without him being present.

C. Ask the patient's son to leave the room - This is the most appropriate next step in management, as the provider needs to be able to assess the patient without the son's influence or potential interference.

D. Call Adult Protective Services to report the patient's son - While it is important to consider the possibility of abuse or neglect, it is not necessary to call Adult Protective Services in this scenario. The provider should focus on assessing the patient's medical condition and determining the appropriate course of treatment."

231,"Sure! Here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 4-month-old boy with a history of multiple infections presents with muscle stiffness and carpopedal spasms, along with a heart murmur on physical exam. Based on your clinical suspicion, you decide to obtain a chest X-ray, which shows a diminished shadow in the mediastinum. What is the most likely genetic mutation causing this patient's presentation?

Options:
A. Chromosome 5 - This chromosome is involved in several genetic disorders that can cause muscle stiffness and spasms, including Becker muscular dystrophy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.
B. Chromosome 7 - This chromosome is associated with several genetic disorders that can cause heart defects, including atrial septal defects and ventricular septal defects.
C. Chromosome 22 - This chromosome is the most likely culprit in this patient's presentation, as it is the chromosome that is affected in individuals with DiGeorge syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by a range of symptoms including muscle stiffness, spasms, and heart defects.
D. Chromosome X - This chromosome is not typically associated with muscle stiffness or spasms, and there are no known genetic disorders that affect this chromosome that would cause these symptoms.

Answer: C. Chromosome 22."
232,"Question: A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 12 hours after ingesting multiple pills. The patient complains of noise in both his ears for the past 10 hours. The patient's vital signs are as follows: pulse rate, 136/min; respirations, 39/min; and blood pressure, 108/72 mm Hg. The physical examination reveals diaphoresis. The serum laboratory parameters are as follows:

Na+ 136 mEq/L
Cl- 99 mEq/L
Arterial blood gas analysis under room air indicates the following results:
pH 7.39
PaCO2 25 mm HG
HCO3- 15 mEq/L

Which of the following is the most appropriate first step in the management of this patient?

A. Gastrointestinal decontamination
B. Hemodialysis
C. Multiple-dose activated charcoal
D. Supportive care

Answer: D. Supportive care

Explanation:

In this scenario, the patient has ingested multiple pills and is experiencing symptoms of poisoning, including noise in both ears and diaphoresis. The serum laboratory parameters indicate a normal electrolyte balance, but the arterial blood gas analysis shows a slightly acidic pH and a normal PaCO2 level, indicating that the patient is experiencing respiratory alkalosis.

Gastrointestinal decontamination (Option A) is not the most appropriate first step in the management of this patient, as the pills have already been absorbed into the body and are causing systemic toxicity. Hemodialysis (Option B) is not necessary in this case, as the patient's blood pressure and electrolyte levels are normal. Multiple-dose activated charcoal (Option C) may be considered to help absorb any remaining toxins in the gut, but it is not the most urgent intervention in this scenario.

Therefore, the most appropriate first step in the management of this patient is supportive care, which includes monitoring the patient's vital signs, providing oxygen therapy as needed, and treating any complications that may arise."
233,"Question: An 11-year-old boy with Burkitt lymphoma is rushed to the emergency department due to nausea, vomiting, flank pain, and dark urine for 1 day. Two days ago, he began induction chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone, and doxorubicin. Urinalysis shows 3+ blood and abundant amber-colored, rhomboid crystals. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. Administration of ceftriaxone - Incorrect. Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic that is not effective in preventing the symptoms of cyclophosphamide-induced nephrotoxicity.

B. Alkalinization of the urine - Correct! Alkalinization of the urine can help to reduce the risk of cyclophosphamide-induced nephrotoxicity by reducing the amount of acidic metabolites that are excreted in the urine.

C. Administration of probenecid - Incorrect. Probenecid is a medication that can increase the excretion of cyclophosphamide in the urine, which may worsen nephrotoxicity.

D. Administration of hydrochlorothiazide - Incorrect. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that can increase urine production, which may worsen nephrotoxicity.

Answer: B. Alkalinization of the urine"
234,"Question: A 56-year-old woman presents with a 6-month history of difficulty swallowing food, initially only with solid food but now also with liquids. She has occasional regurgitation of food when lying down. She has a history of avid birdwatching and returned from a 3-week trip to the Amazon rainforest 3 months ago. She has experienced a 3.5-kg (7.7-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months and has not had abdominal pain, blood in her stools, or fever. She underwent an abdominal hysterectomy for fibroid uterus 6 years ago and has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years. Her current medications include metformin and sitagliptin. The examination shows no abnormalities, and her hemoglobin concentration is 12.2 g/dL. A barium esophagram is shown, which reveals a narrowing of the esophageal lumen. Esophageal manometry monitoring shows the lower esophageal sphincter fails to relax during swallowing. The next best step in management is:

A. Gastroesophageal endoscopy: This is the next best step in management as it can help to identify any underlying causes of the difficulty swallowing, such as inflammation, ulcers, or tumors. Endoscopy can also help to assess the lower esophageal sphincter function and determine if there is any evidence of esophageal motility disorders.

B. Giemsa stain of blood smear: This is not the next best step in management as it is not related to the patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing and weight loss.

C. Myotomy with fundoplication: This is not the next best step in management as it is a surgical procedure that is typically used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), not difficulty swallowing.

D. CT scan of the chest and abdomen: This is not the next best step in management as it is not specific to the patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing and weight loss. A CT scan may be useful in evaluating other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a tumor or inflammation, but it is not the next best step in management of the patient's current symptoms."
235,"Question: A 10-year-old boy is brought to a pediatric clinic by his parents with pain and weakness in the lower extremities for the past 3 weeks. The patient's mother says that he has been active until the weakness and pain started during his soccer practice sessions. He says he also experiences muscle cramps, especially at night. His mother adds that he constantly wakes up in the night to urinate and is noticeably thirsty most of the time. The patient denies any recent history of trauma to his legs. His vaccinations are up to date and his family history is unremarkable. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are shown below:

Laboratory test
Serum potassium 3.3 mEq/L

Po2 88 mm Hg

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

A. Gitelman's syndrome
B. Bartter syndrome
C. Liddle syndrome
D. Conn's syndrome

Answer: A. Gitelman's syndrome

Rationale: The patient's laboratory results indicate a hypokalemic alkalosis, which is consistent with Gitelman's syndrome. Gitelman's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the kidneys' ability to regulate electrolyte levels. It is characterized by a loss of potassium in the urine, leading to hypokalemia, and an excessive loss of hydrogen ions, leading to an alkalosis. The patient's symptoms of pain and weakness in the lower extremities, muscle cramps, and nocturnal urination are also consistent with Gitelman's syndrome. While Bartter syndrome, Liddle syndrome, and Conn's syndrome are also causes of hypokalemic alkalosis, they have different clinical presentations and laboratory findings."
236,"Question: A 56-year-old woman presents to a physician for evaluation of a lump in her left breast. She noticed the lump last week while taking a shower and has been experiencing gradual growth over the past few days. The lump is not painful and is located in the upper outer quadrant of her breast. She has a history of smoking for the past 30 years. On examination, the physician notices bilateral small nodules that are non-tender and immobile. A mammography confirms the masses and fine needle aspiration cytology of the lesions reveals malignant cells arranged in a row of cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Inflammatory carcinoma
B. Fibroadenoma
C. Invasive ductal carcinoma
D. Invasive lobular carcinoma

Answer: D. Invasive lobular carcinoma

Rationale: Invasive lobular carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and findings on examination. The gradual growth of the lump over time, its non-tender and immobile nature, and the presence of malignant cells arranged in a row of cells on fine needle aspiration cytology are all consistent with this diagnosis. Inflammatory carcinoma and fibroadenoma are less likely given the patient's age and medical history, while invasive ductal carcinoma is also a possibility, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not strongly support this diagnosis."
237,"Question: A 64-year-old woman visits her physician's office to obtain the results of her recent abdominal CT scan. She has been experiencing fatigue, weight loss, and jaundice for the past six months, and has a significant medical history of hypothyroidism, generalized anxiety disorder, and hyperlipidemia. The patient takes levothyroxine, sertraline, and atorvastatin. Her vital signs are stable today, and upon physical examination, her skin shows slight jaundice without any scleral icterus, and the abdomen is non-tender, without any guarding or masses. The CT scan reveals a 3 x 3 cm mass located at the head of the pancreas. Which of the following options is most appropriate for delivering the bad news to the patient?

A. Set aside a suitable amount of time in your schedule, ensuring that you will not be interrupted during the conversation, and explain the bad news to the patient directly.

B. Ask a family member or close relative to attend the appointment, explain the bad news to them, and have them share the information with the patient, considering their closer relationship.

C. Inform the patient over the phone about the bad news and offer them the option to make an office visit if they prefer.

D. Train one of the nursing staff members on this situation and delegate this responsibility as part of their job duties."

The patient has had no other symptoms aside from mild rhinorrhea and cough. He has no past medical history, and is on no medications except for over-the-counter medications for his fever. His temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), pulse is 96/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 108/80 mmHg. The patient appears lethargic and is oriented only to person. Otherwise, the physical exam is benign and the patient has no other neurologic symptoms. What is the mechanism of the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?

A. Bacterial infection: This option is incorrect because the patient's symptoms, such as vomiting and lethargy, are more consistent with a viral infection rather than a bacterial infection.

B. Chemical ingestion: This option is also incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient ingested anything harmful.

C. Reversible enzyme inhibition: This option is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a reversible enzyme inhibition, which is a condition that can cause temporary alterations in brain function.

D. Irreversible enzyme inhibition: This option is the correct answer. Irreversible enzyme inhibition can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, including lethargy, confusion, and altered mental status, which are all consistent with the patient's presentation. This condition occurs when a toxin or other substance binds irreversibly to an enzyme in the brain, leading to a permanent alteration in brain function. The most common cause of irreversible enzyme inhibition is a viral infection, such as encephalitis or meningitis."
239,"Question: A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of crushing chest pain, difficulty breathing, and palpitations. What is the best next step for this patient?

Options:

A. Start heparin infusion and ICU admission
B. Perform an urgent bedside echocardiography
C. Urgent percutaneous coronary intervention
D. Monitor closely and wait for cardiac troponin levels

Answer: C. Urgent percutaneous coronary intervention

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of crushing chest pain, difficulty breathing, and palpitations, along with the ECG finding of ST-segment elevation, suggest a possible acute coronary event, such as an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the urgent treatment of choice for AMI, as it can reperfuse the affected myocardial area and reduce the risk of further damage. Starting heparin infusion and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) are important steps in managing AMI, but they are not the immediate next steps in this scenario. Bedside echocardiography may be considered if the patient's condition deteriorates or if there are concerns about cardiac tamponade, but it is not a necessary step in this case. Monitoring the patient closely and waiting for cardiac troponin levels may not be sufficient to manage the patient's acute coronary event."
240,"Question: A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. She reports that the pain started last night and has been worsening over time. She denies any history of drug use or sexual intercourse. Her vital signs are within normal limits, except for a temperature of 99.0°F (37.2°C). A rectal exam is performed, and she is subsequently disimpacted. Five kilograms of stool are removed from the patient, and her symptoms resolve afterward. Initial laboratory tests reveal the following:

Urine:

* Color: Yellow
* Protein: Negative
* Red blood cells: Negative
* hCG: Positive (1,000 mIU/mL)

What is the best next step in management?

A. Laparoscopy
B. Methotrexate
C. Salpingostomy
D. Ultrasound and serum hCG in 48 hours

Answer: D. Ultrasound and serum hCG in 48 hours

Rationale:

The patient's positive hCG result and lack of a gestational sac on transvaginal ultrasound suggest a possible ectopic pregnancy. While laparoscopy could be considered as a next step, it is not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms have resolved after disimpaction and stool removal. Methotrexate is not a appropriate treatment for ectopic pregnancy, and salpingostomy is not a diagnostic test for ectopic pregnancy. Therefore, the best next step is to perform an ultrasound and measure the serum hCG level again in 48 hours to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of action."
241,"Question: A 67-year-old woman presents to her physician for a regular checkup. She has a history of arterial hypertension, takes hydrochlorothiazide and valsartan, and recently suffered an ulnar fracture after a fall. Which medication is most likely to be prescribed to her after additional investigations, considering her history and presentation?

Options:
A. Estrogen plus progestin
B. Cholecalciferol
C. Tocopherol
D. Denosumab

Answer: B. Cholecalciferol

Rationale: The patient's history of osteoporosis and recent fall suggest a high risk of fracture. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D) is a common medication used to prevent and treat osteoporosis, particularly in postmenopausal women like the patient. The patient's height and weight, as well as her medical history of arterial hypertension, also support the prescription of cholecalciferol. Estrogen plus progestin, tocopherol, and denosumab are not as relevant to the patient's condition."
242,"Question: A 21-year-old woman is evaluated for dry cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness which occur episodically 1–2 times per week. She notes that she develops significant shortness of breath when running, especially during cool weather. She also says she has 1 episode of coughing attacks during the night per month. She denies any history of tobacco use. Medical history is significant for atopic dermatitis as a child, although she now rarely experiences skin flares. Family history is non-contributory. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure of 115/75 mm Hg, and heart rate of 88/min. Her pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. Physical examination reveals normal air entry and no wheezes. A chest X-ray is normal. Spirometry findings are within normal parameters. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient’s condition?

A. Methacholine challenge test

The Methacholine challenge test is the best next step in the management of this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms of dry cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, particularly during cool weather, are consistent with exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB). The Methacholine challenge test can help confirm the diagnosis of EIB by measuring the patient's responsiveness to methacholine, a bronchial stimulant. The test can help identify the level of bronchial responsiveness and guide treatment decisions.

B. Skin-prick testing

Skin-prick testing is not the best next step in the management of this patient's condition. The patient does not have a history of allergies or atopic dermatitis, and there are no other symptoms suggestive of an allergic condition. Skin-prick testing is primarily used to diagnose allergies, and it is not relevant to the patient's symptoms of EIB.

C. Ciliary studies

Ciliary studies are not the best next step in the management of this patient's condition. The patient does not have a history of respiratory infections or ciliary dysfunction, and there are no other symptoms suggestive of a ciliary disorder. Ciliary studies are primarily used to diagnose ciliary disorders, and they are not relevant to the patient's symptoms of EIB.

D. Clinical observation without further evaluation

Clinical observation without further evaluation is not the best next step in the management of this patient's condition. While the patient's symptoms may be mild and intermittent, they can have a significant impact on her quality of life, and further evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of EIB and develop an appropriate treatment plan."
243,"Question: A 57-year-old man presents with fever and yellow discoloration of the skin for the past 4 days. He denies any recent weight loss or changes in urine or stool color. His past medical history is unremarkable. He admits to drinking about 130 g/day of alcohol and says he has been doing so for the past 25 years. His wife who is accompanying him during this visit adds that once her husband drank 15 cans of beer at a funeral. The patient also reports a 10-pack-year smoking history. His vital signs include: pulse 98/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 38.2°C (100.8°F) and blood pressure 120/90 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient appears jaundiced and is ill-appearing. Sclera is icteric. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant with no rebound or guarding. Percussion reveals significant hepatomegaly extending 3 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory studies are significant for the following:
Sodium 135 mEq/L
Potassium 3.5 mEq/L
ALT 240 mEq/L
AST 500 mEq/L
A liver biopsy is obtained but the results are pending. Which of the following would most likely be seen in this patient’s biopsy?

A. 'Florid' bile duct lesion: This is a likely finding in the liver biopsy of a patient with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). The term ""florid"" refers to the presence of numerous small bile ducts that are dilated and filled with bile, which is a characteristic feature of ALD.

B. Steatosis alone: Steatosis is the accumulation of fat in liver cells, which can occur in ALD. However, it is not a characteristic feature of alcoholic hepatitis, which is the inflammatory condition that the patient is likely experiencing.

C. Mallory-Denk bodies: Mallory-Denk bodies are small, round or oval-shaped structures composed of degenerated hepatocytes that are seen in the liver biopsy of patients with alcoholic hepatitis. They are a hallmark of this condition.

D. Hürthle cells: Hürthle cells are rare in ALD and are not typically seen in liver biopsies of patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

Answer: C. Mallory-Denk bodies"
244,"Question: The 79-year-old man hospitalized for overnight monitoring after elective surgery is found to be confused and disoriented on morning rounds, exhibiting symptoms of delirium after being moved to the inpatient floor unit. Which of the following drugs could be administered to reverse the effects of the drug that was given to the patient?

Options:
A. Ammonium chloride
B. Flumazenil
C. Naloxone
D. Sodium bicarbonate

Answer: B. Flumazenil

Explanation: Flumazenil is a drug that can reverse the effects of benzodiazepines, which is the class of drugs that the drug given to the patient is likely to belong to. The symptoms observed in the patient, such as weakness, tremors, uncoordinated muscle movements, blurred vision, and disorientation, are consistent with the effects of benzodiazepine overdose or withdrawal. Administering flumazenil can help reverse these symptoms and normalize the patient's neurological function. Ammonium chloride, naloxone, and sodium bicarbonate are not effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines or the drug given to the patient."
245,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 49-year-old man who is being treated for Helicobacter pylori infection visits his primary care physician with complaints of lower back pain. Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, which non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) would be the most appropriate initial treatment option?

Options:
A. Ibuprofen: A commonly used NSAID for short-term pain relief, ibuprofen is effective in reducing inflammation and pain.
B. Codeine: A weaker opioid than other options, codeine may be considered for long-term pain management, but it carries a higher risk of addiction and side effects.
C. Bismuth: Not an NSAID, bismuth is used to treat gastrointestinal issues like ulcers and gastritis, but it is not effective in managing pain.
D. Celecoxib: A COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib is a preferable option for long-term pain management due to its lower risk of gastrointestinal side effects compared to other NSAIDs.

Answer: D. Celecoxib"
246,"Question: A 74-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a 2-week history of increasing weakness and chills, along with difficulty breathing over the past three days. She has a history of left hemicolectomy for adenocarcinoma of the colon, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis with lumbar pain, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years and does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her current medications include warfarin, metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin. On examination, she appears lethargic and has a large conjunctival hemorrhage in her left eye. Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 126/79 mm Hg. Cardiac auscultation reveals a new holosystolic murmur over the apex. Abdominal examination shows mild, diffuse tenderness throughout the upper quadrants and a well-healed 12-cm paramedian scar. There are multiple tender nodules on the palmar surface of her fingertips. Funduscopic examination shows retinal hemorrhages with pale centers. An ECG shows atrial fibrillation and right bundle branch block.

Options:

A. Pulmonary metastases: Unlikely, as there is no history of lung disease or symptoms suggestive of metastatic disease.
B. Streptococcus sanguinis infection: Unlikely, as there are no symptoms or signs suggestive of a bacterial infection.
C. Cardiobacterium hominis infection: Unlikely, as there are no symptoms or signs suggestive of a bacterial infection.
D. Enterococcus faecalis infection: Likely, as the patient has a history of recent surgery and is taking anticoagulants, which can increase the risk of enterococcal infection. The conjunctival hemorrhage and retinal hemorrhages also support this diagnosis.

Answer: D. Enterococcus faecalis infection."
247,"Question: A 3-day-old boy is brought to the pediatrician for nonpigmented vomiting for the last day. A detailed developmental history reveals that his parents have a nonconsanguineous marriage. He was born by cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation. His birth weight was 2.6 kg (5.7 lb) and he has been breastfed exclusively. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 120/min, and respiratory rate is 35/min. On physical examination, a distended abdomen and signs of dehydration are present. On abdominal imaging, a 'double bubble' sign and upper intestinal obstruction is present. Abdominal computed tomography shows narrowing of the second part of the duodenum. Barium enema shows normal rotation of the colon. Which of the following is most likely cause of intestinal obstruction in this patient?

A. Meckel diverticulum
B. Annular pancreas
C. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency
D. Crigler-Najjar type 1

Answer: B. Annular pancreas

The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with an annular pancreas, a rare congenital abnormality where the pancreas fails to properly develop and form a normal pancreatic ductal system. This can lead to intestinal obstruction and vomiting, as seen in the patient. The other options are less likely causes of the patient's condition. Meckel diverticulum is a small outpouching of the small intestine that can occur in rare cases, but it is not typically associated with intestinal obstruction. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that can affect the immune system and increase the risk of infections, but it is not associated with intestinal obstruction. Crigler-Najjar type 1 is a rare genetic disorder that affects the bile acid transport system and can lead to jaundice and other symptoms, but it is not typically associated with intestinal obstruction."
248,"Question: A 7-month-old boy is brought to the pediatrician for a change in his behavior. The patient has been breastfeeding up until this point and has been meeting his developmental milestones. He is in the 90th percentile for weight and 89th percentile for height. This past week, the patient has been lethargic, vomiting, and has been refusing to eat. The patient's parents state that he had an episode this morning where he was not responsive and was moving his extremities abnormally followed by a period of somnolence. The patient's past medical history is notable for shoulder dystocia and poorly managed maternal diabetes during the pregnancy. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 60/30 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, you note a lethargic infant with a sweet smell to his breath. Which of the following is most likely deficient in this patient?

A. Aldolase B

The patient's symptoms of lethargy, vomiting, and refusal to eat, along with the history of shoulder dystocia and poorly managed maternal diabetes during pregnancy, suggest that the patient may have hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Aldolase B is an enzyme that is involved in glycolysis, the breakdown of glucose for energy production. Therefore, it is unlikely that Aldolase B is deficient in this patient.

B. Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase

Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase is an enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of galactose, a sugar that is found in breast milk. While the patient has been breastfeeding, it is unlikely that this enzyme is deficient in this patient.

C. Glucose

Glucose is the primary source of energy for the body, and hypoglycemia can occur when the body's glucose levels fall below a certain threshold. The patient's symptoms of lethargy, vomiting, and refusal to eat, along with the history of shoulder dystocia and poorly managed maternal diabetes during pregnancy, suggest that the patient may have hypoglycemia.

D. Ornithine transcarbamolase

Ornithine transcarbamolase is an enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of ammonia, a byproduct of protein metabolism. While this enzyme may be deficient in certain genetic disorders, it is unlikely to be deficient in this patient due to the patient's symptoms and medical history.

Therefore, the most likely deficient enzyme in this patient is Glucose."
249,"Question: A 67-year-old woman has fallen from the second story level of her home while hanging laundry and presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. Which of the following diagnostic tests is best indicated for her evaluation?

A. Ultrasound: Given the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and rigidity, an ultrasound examination can help identify any internal injuries, such as bleeding or organ damage, that may have occurred due to the fall. An ultrasound can also help assess the patient's abdominal fluid status and identify any intra-abdominal bleeding.

B. Peritoneal lavage: A peritoneal lavage is not the best option for this patient as it is not diagnostic of internal injuries. Peritoneal lavage is used to collect fluid and debris from the peritoneal cavity, but it may not provide valuable diagnostic information in this case.

C. CT scan: A CT scan is a better option than an ultrasound for evaluating the patient's abdominal injuries. A CT scan can provide detailed images of the patient's internal organs and can help identify any injuries, such as bleeding or organ damage, that may have occurred due to the fall.

D. Diagnostic laparotomy: A diagnostic laparotomy is not necessary for this patient as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with abdominal injuries that can be evaluated with a CT scan. A diagnostic laparotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the abdomen to evaluate the internal organs, and it is usually reserved for patients with severe abdominal injuries that cannot be evaluated with other diagnostic tests."
250,"Question: A 55-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for knee pain. The patient has had left knee pain, which has been steadily worsening for the past year. He states that ice and rest has led to minor improvement in his symptoms. He recently bumped his knee; however, he says that it has not altered his baseline pain when ambulating. The patient is a butcher and lives with his wife. His current medications include insulin, metformin, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril. He is attending Alcoholics Anonymous with little success. Physical exam reveals a left knee that is mildly erythematous with some bruising. There is no pain upon palpation of the joint or with passive range of motion. The patient exhibits a mildly antalgic gait. Which of the following is the best initial step in management?

A. Aspirin: Aspirin is not the best initial step in management for this patient's knee pain. Aspirin is an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to manage acute pain and inflammation. However, in this patient's case, the knee pain has been steadily worsening over the past year, suggesting that it may be a chronic condition rather than an acute injury. Additionally, the patient's history of bumping his knee recently suggests that there may be an underlying injury or trauma that requires further evaluation and management.

B. Colchicine: Colchicine is not the best initial step in management for this patient's knee pain. Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory medication that is commonly used to manage gout flares. However, it is not effective in managing chronic knee pain, and it may have side effects such as gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea.

C. MRI: An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan is not the best initial step in management for this patient's knee pain. While an MRI can provide valuable information about the structure of the knee joint and may help identify any underlying injuries or conditions, it is not necessary in this patient's case. The patient's history of steadily worsening knee pain over the past year, along with the recent bump to the knee, suggests that there may be an underlying injury or condition that requires further evaluation and management.

D. Weight loss: Weight loss is the best initial step in management for this patient's knee pain. Excess weight can place additional stress on the knee joint, which can exacerbate knee pain. By losing weight, the patient may be able to reduce the stress on the knee joint and alleviate his symptoms. Additionally, weight loss can improve the patient's overall health and reduce his risk of developing other chronic conditions.

Answer: D. Weight loss"
251,"Question: The 21-year-old female patient has been experiencing a variety of symptoms, including generalized tonic-clonic seizures, body tremors, agitation, and mood changes, for several days. Her brother has relayed that she recently ran out of her medication for severe anxiety, which may be contributing to her symptoms. Which of the following treatments would be most appropriate to address the patient's condition?

Options:
A. Diazepam: This benzodiazepine is commonly used to treat anxiety disorders, including seizures associated with anxiety. It can help to calm the patient and reduce agitation.
B. Methadone: While methadone can be used to treat opioid addiction, it is not typically used to treat anxiety disorders.
C. Varenicline: This medication is used to treat nicotine addiction, but it has also been shown to have anxiolytic effects and may be useful in treating the patient's anxiety.
D. Flumazenil: This medication is used to treat benzodiazepine overdose, but it is not typically used to treat anxiety disorders.

Answer: A. Diazepam"
252,"Question: A 3-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department in respiratory distress after her parents noticed that she was having difficulty breathing. They say that she developed a fever 2 days ago and subsequently developed increasing respiratory difficulty, lethargy, and productive cough. On presentation, her temperature is 103°F (39.5°C), blood pressure is 84/58 mmHg, pulse is 141/min, and respirations are 48/min. Physical exam reveals subcostal retractions and consolidation in the right lower lung field. She is also found to have coarse facial features and restricted joint movement. Serum laboratory tests reveal abnormally elevated levels of lysosomal enzymes circulating in the blood. The enzyme that is most likely defective in this patient has which of the following substrates?

A. Ceremide: Ceremide is not a substrate for any known lysosomal enzyme defect.

B. Dermatan sulfate: Dermatan sulfate is not a substrate for any known lysosomal enzyme defect.

C. Galactocerebroside: Galactocerebroside is a substrate for the lysosomal enzyme galactocerebrosidase, which is deficient in certain lysosomal storage disorders, such as Gaucher disease.

D. Mannose: Mannose is a substrate for the lysosomal enzyme mannosidase, which is deficient in certain lysosomal storage disorders, such as Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (Hurler syndrome).

Answer: D. Mannose"
253,"Question: A 63-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a high-speed motor vehicle collision, and he is obtunded on arrival. He is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. On the third day of intubation, his temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 91/min, and blood pressure is 103/60 mm Hg. There are decreased breath sounds over the left lung base, and an x-ray of the chest shows deepening of the costophrenic angle on the left side. The arterial blood gas analysis shows:

pH 7.49
pCO2 29 mm Hg
pO2 73 mm Hg
HCO3- 20 mEq/L
O2 saturation 89%

Monitoring shows a sudden increase in the plateau airway pressure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Administer levofloxacin
B. Insertion of a chest tube
C. CT scan of the chest
D. Close observation

Answer: B. Insertion of a chest tube

Rationale: The patient's decreased breath sounds over the left lung base and deepening of the costophrenic angle on the left side suggest a pneumothorax, which can lead to respiratory failure and cardiac complications. Insertion of a chest tube can help to drain the pus and air from the pleural space, relieve the pressure on the lung, and improve the patient's respiratory function. While antibiotics may be necessary to treat any underlying infection, the immediate priority is to manage the respiratory compromise and prevent further complications. CT scan of the chest may provide additional information about the extent of the pneumothorax, but it is not the most urgent intervention at this time. Close observation may be appropriate, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management."
254,"Question: A 4-day-old male infant is brought to the physician because of respiratory distress and bluish discoloration of his lips and tongue. He was born at term and the antenatal period was uncomplicated. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 170/min, respirations are 65/min, and blood pressure is 70/46 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard over the left lower sternal border. A single S2 that does not split with respiration is present. Echocardiography shows defects in the interatrial and interventricular septae, as well as an imperforate muscular septum between the right atrium and right ventricle. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?

A. Increased pulmonary vascular markings on chest x-ray
B. Left-axis deviation on electrocardiogram
C. Elfin facies
D. Delta wave on electrocardiogram

Answer: B. Left-axis deviation on electrocardiogram

Explanation:
The patient's echocardiography results reveal defects in the interatrial and interventricular septae, as well as an imperforate muscular septum between the right atrium and right ventricle, which are consistent with a diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot. The left-axis deviation on the electrocardiogram is a common finding in patients with tetralogy of Fallot, as the abnormal septal defects can cause a shift in the electrical activity of the heart. The other options are not relevant to the patient's condition."
255,"Question: A 71-year-old woman presents to the clinic with compression fractures of her L1 and L2 vertebral bodies due to osteoporosis. What is the main cause of her osteoporosis?

Options:
A. Decreased estrogen levels
B. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) therapy
C. Calcium malabsorption
D. Bone depletion due to chronic corticosteroid use

Answer: D. Bone depletion due to chronic corticosteroid use

Explanation: The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and chronic corticosteroid use for the past 2 years suggests that the main cause of her osteoporosis is bone depletion due to chronic corticosteroid use. Corticosteroids can cause bone loss by reducing bone density and increasing the risk of fractures, especially in older adults. The patient's history of hypertension and hydrochlorothiazide therapy are not directly related to the patient's osteoporosis, and calcium malabsorption is not a common cause of osteoporosis in this patient population."
256,"Question: A 32-year-old woman presents with a 2-week history of involuntary loss of urine. She experiences small amounts of urine loss in the absence of an urge to urinate and without any apparent reason. She also reports an intermittent urinary stream. Two years ago, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Currently, she takes glatiramer acetate and a multivitamin. She works as a librarian and has two children in middle school. Her vital signs are normal, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender. The pelvic examination shows no abnormalities, and the neurological examination reveals a slight hypesthesia in the lower left arm and absent abdominal reflex, but otherwise no abnormalities. Her post-void residual urine volume is 131 mL, and her bladder size is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's urinary incontinence?

A. Cognitive impairment: The patient's history of multiple sclerosis and the neurological examination findings suggest that cognitive impairment may be a contributing factor to her urinary incontinence. However, this is not the most likely cause of her symptoms.

B. Vesicovaginal fistula: A vesicovaginal fistula is a rare but possible cause of urinary incontinence. However, the patient's history and examination findings do not suggest that this is the most likely explanation for her symptoms.

C. Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia: Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia is a condition characterized by abnormal contractions of the detrusor muscle and the sphincter muscle, leading to urinary incontinence. The patient's history of multiple sclerosis and the neurological examination findings suggest that this may be the most likely cause of her urinary incontinence.

D. Impaired detrusor contractility: Impaired detrusor contractility can also cause urinary incontinence. However, the patient's history and examination findings do not suggest that this is the most likely explanation for her symptoms.

Answer: C. Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia."
257,"Question: Two days after admission to the hospital, a 74-year-old man develops confusion and headache. He has also been vomiting over the past hour. His temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg. He is lethargic and oriented only to person. Examination shows flushed skin. Fundoscopic examination shows bright red retinal veins. Serum studies show: Na+ 138 mEq/L, K+ 3.5 mEq/L, Cl- 100 mEq/L, HCO3- 17 mEq/L, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL, Urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, Lactate 8.0 mEq/L (N = 0.5 - 2.2 mEq/L), Glucose 75 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows a pH of 7.13. This patient's current presentation is most likely due to treatment for which of the following conditions?

A. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's elevated blood pressure (140/80 mm Hg) and bright red retinal veins on fundoscopy suggest the possibility of a hypertensive crisis.

B. Tension headache: The patient's headache and lethargy could be indicative of a tension headache, but the other symptoms and signs do not fully support this diagnosis.

C. Major depressive disorder: The patient's confusion, lethargy, and flushed skin could be symptoms of a major depressive disorder, but the retinal vein distension and other laboratory abnormalities suggest a different diagnosis.

D. Acute dystonia: The patient's confusion, lethargy, and flushed skin could be symptoms of acute dystonia, but the other laboratory abnormalities and the patient's age do not support this diagnosis.

Answer: A. Hypertensive crisis"
258,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 16-year-old boy with a history of seizure disorder is rushed to the Emergency Department after experiencing multiple generalized tonic-clonic seizures that have lasted over 30 minutes. Despite efforts to restore consciousness, he remains unresponsive. What is the most appropriate initial pharmacological intervention?

Options:
A. Phenytoin
B. Carbamazepine
C. Gabapentin
D. Lorazepam

Answer: D. Lorazepam"
259,"Question: A 72-year-old male patient presents to his primary care physician for a wellness visit, complaining of recurring episodes of chest pain and lightheadedness. He recently experienced a fall after feeling lightheaded and experiencing blurred vision. According to his wife, he was unconscious for about 5 seconds before spontaneously recovering. The patient experiences pressure-like discomfort in his chest and lightheadedness with exertion, as well as shortness of breath when climbing stairs. His medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Cardiac auscultation reveals a systolic ejection murmur at the right upper border and a normal S1 and soft S2. Which of the following is most likely to be present in this patient?

A. Bicuspid aortic valve
B. Decreased murmur intensity with squatting
C. Increased blood flow velocity through the aortic valve
D. Pulsus paradoxus

Answer: C. Increased blood flow velocity through the aortic valve.

The patient's symptoms of chest pain and lightheadedness, along with the cardiac auscultation findings of a systolic ejection murmur at the right upper border, suggest that the patient may have atherosclerosis or coronary artery disease. The increased blood flow velocity through the aortic valve is a common finding in patients with coronary artery disease, as the heart works harder to pump blood through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. This is in contrast to the other options, which are less likely to be present in this patient based on the symptoms and cardiac auscultation findings."
260,"Question: An 80-year-old man presents to the emergency department with gnawing substernal chest pain that radiates to his neck and left jaw, accompanied by newly developing Q waves on his 12-lead ECG. He is admitted for treatment, but 4 days later, he experiences a sudden decline in mental status and a significant drop in blood pressure. Physical examination reveals jugular venous distention, pulsus paradoxus, and distant heart sounds. What is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?

Options:

A. Acute pulmonary edema causing right heart failure: This option is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest pulmonary edema.

B. Arrhythmia caused by ventricular fibrillation: While an arrhythmia could be a possible cause of the patient's symptoms, the presence of ST-segment elevation and newly developing Q waves on the ECG suggests that the underlying cause is more likely a cardiac condition.

C. Compression of heart chambers by blood in the pericardial space: This option is the most likely cause of the patient's condition. Pericardial effusion, or the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space surrounding the heart, can compress the heart chambers and disrupt cardiac function, leading to symptoms such as chest pain, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus, and distant heart sounds.

D. Pericardial inflammation: While pericardial inflammation can cause symptoms similar to those described in this case, it is less likely to cause a sudden drop in blood pressure 4 days after hospitalization.

Answer: C. Compression of heart chambers by blood in the pericardial space."
261,"Question: A 31-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a history of fever and vomiting for 2 days and severe headache for a day. Physical examination reveals a pink-purple petechial rash on her chest and legs, and she is in great distress due to pain. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Meningitis
B. Encephalitis
C. Migraine
D. Sinusitis

Answer: B. Encephalitis

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of fever, vomiting, and severe headache, along with the presence of a pink-purple petechial rash, are highly suggestive of encephalitis. The patient's history of migraine does not fit with the current presentation, and sinusitis is less likely given the absence of nasal symptoms. Meningitis is also possible, but the patient's age and the presence of a petechial rash argue against this diagnosis."
262,"Question: A 59-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a 5-month history of breathing difficulties. He reports experiencing exertional dyspnea accompanied by a nonproductive cough. His past medical history includes a solitary lung nodule that was surgically removed 10 years ago and found to be benign. He works as a secretary for a coal mining company, does not smoke, and drinks socially with friends. His family history is significant for autoimmune diseases. Physical exam reveals fine bibasilar inspiratory crackles in both lungs, and laboratory testing is negative for antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor. Which of the following is most likely to be the cause of this patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. Anticancer agents - This option is not associated with the patient's symptoms, as there is no mention of any cancer treatment in the patient's history.

B. Interstitial lymphoid infiltrates in lung tissue - This option is also not associated with the patient's symptoms, as there is no mention of any abnormal lung tissue findings on physical exam or in laboratory testing.

C. Subpleural cystic enlargement - This option is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Subpleural cystic enlargement is a common finding in patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which is an inflammatory condition that can cause breathing difficulties and coughing. The patient's history of exposure to dust and chemicals at work, as well as his family history of autoimmune diseases, suggest that he may be at risk for developing this condition.

D. Type III hypersensitivity reaction - This option is not associated with the patient's symptoms, as there is no mention of any evidence of an allergic reaction in the patient's history or physical exam findings.

Answer: C. Subpleural cystic enlargement"
263,"Question: A 59-year-old woman presents with a 1-month history of episodic cough and shortness of breath. She experiences worsening of symptoms with exertion and at night. There is no chest pain or palpitations. Eight weeks ago, she had a fever, sore throat, and nasal congestion. She has a 10-year history of hypertension and has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for 16 years. Her pulse is 78/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 145/95 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Diffuse end-expiratory wheezes are heard on pulmonary auscultation. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 65% and an FEV1 of 60%. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Pneumonia: Pneumonia is a possible diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms of cough and shortness of breath, especially since she has a history of respiratory infections. However, the absence of chest pain or palpitations and the presence of wheezes on pulmonary auscultation suggest that pneumonia is less likely.

B. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): GERD can cause symptoms of cough and shortness of breath, particularly at night. The patient's history of smoking and hypertension also increase the likelihood of GERD as a diagnosis. However, the absence of heartburn or regurgitation suggests that GERD is less likely.

C. Asthma: The patient's symptoms of cough and shortness of breath, particularly worsening with exertion and at night, are classic for asthma. The presence of wheezes on pulmonary auscultation and the low FEV1:FVC ratio also support an asthma diagnosis. The patient's history of smoking and hypertension increase the likelihood of asthma.

D. Chronic bronchitis: Chronic bronchitis is a condition characterized by a chronic cough and excessive mucus production. However, the patient's symptoms of cough and shortness of breath are more consistent with asthma than chronic bronchitis. Additionally, the absence of mucus production and the presence of wheezes on pulmonary auscultation suggest that asthma is more likely."
264,"Question: A 66-year-old man has new, intermittent upper abdominal discomfort after undergoing open surgery to repair bilateral inguinal hernias. He also experiences new shortness of breath that resolves with rest. What is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen
B. Culture swab from the surgical site
C. Coronary angiography
D. Cardiac pharmacological stress test

Answer: D. Cardiac pharmacological stress test

Rationale: The patient's new symptoms of intermittent upper abdominal discomfort and shortness of breath are concerning for potential cardiac etiologies, such as ischemia or infarction. A cardiac pharmacological stress test would be the most appropriate next step in diagnosis to evaluate the patient's cardiovascular function and identify any potential underlying cardiac conditions. The other options are not as relevant to the patient's symptoms and medical history."
265,"Question: A 34-year-old woman presents to the physician a week after discovering a lump in her left breast. She was discharged from the hospital three months ago after treatment for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her mother passed away from ovarian cancer. Physical examination reveals a 2.5-cm, non-tender mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Mammography shows a circumscribed radiolucent lesion with a rim of peripheral calcification. A photomicrograph of tissue from a biopsy of the mass is provided. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the breast swelling?

Options:

A. Thrombophlebitis of subcutaneous veins: This is a condition where a blood clot forms in the subcutaneous veins, which can cause swelling in the affected area. However, the photomicrograph of the biopsy tissue does not show any evidence of thrombosis or inflammation, making this option less likely.

B. Stimulation of estrogen receptors: Estrogen receptors are found in the breast tissue and can become stimulated by the presence of estrogen, leading to cell growth and division. However, the patient's history of taking an oral contraceptive, which contains estrogen, does not necessarily mean that the breast swelling is caused by stimulation of estrogen receptors.

C. Defect in DNA repair: DNA repair is an essential process that helps maintain the integrity of genetic material. A defect in DNA repair can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and division, which can result in breast cancer. However, the patient's history of a family history of ovarian cancer does not necessarily indicate a defect in DNA repair as the cause of the breast swelling.

D. Release of cytoplasmic triglycerides: Cytoplasmic triglycerides are fatty molecules that are stored in the cytoplasm of cells. The release of these triglycerides can cause swelling in the affected area. The photomicrograph of the biopsy tissue shows evidence of lipid accumulation, which supports this option as the most likely cause of the breast swelling.

Answer: D. Release of cytoplasmic triglycerides."
266,"Question: A 75-year-old male presents to the emergency room complaining of severe lower abdominal pain and an inability to urinate. He reports that he last urinated approximately nine hours ago. When asked to urinate, only a few drops dribble from the tip of his penis. Further questioning reveals that the patient has experienced progressively worsening difficulty with urinating over the past two years. He has lived alone for five years since his wife passed away. He has not seen a doctor in that time. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 145/90 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 22/min. He appears to be in severe pain. Physical examination reveals a distended bladder and significant tenderness to palpation over the inferior aspect of his abdomen. Which of the following sets of lab values would most likely be found in a urinalysis of this patient?

A. Urine osmolality 400 mOsmol/kg H2O, Urine Na+ 25 mEq/L, FENa 1.5%, no casts

B. Urine osmolality 200 mOsmol/kg H2O, Urine Na+ 35 mEq/L, FENa 3%, muddy brown casts

C. Urine osmolality 550 mOsmol/kg H2O, Urine Na+ 15 mEq/L, FENa 0.9%, red blood cell casts

D. Urine osmolality 300 mOsmol/kg H2O, Urine Na+ 45 mEq/L, FENa 5%, no casts

Answer: D. Urine osmolality 300 mOsmol/kg H2O, Urine Na+ 45 mEq/L, FENa 5%, no casts

Rationale: The patient's history of progressively worsening difficulty with urination over the past two years, along with the current inability to urinate and severe abdominal pain, suggest a possible diagnosis of urinary retention or urinary tract obstruction. A urinalysis would likely reveal a high urine osmolality, as the kidneys are trying to concentrate the urine in response to the decreased urine volume. The patient's urine Na+ level is also likely to be elevated, as the kidneys are trying to retain Na+ to maintain fluid balance. The presence of red blood cell casts or muddy brown casts would suggest a more severe obstruction or infection. However, in this case, the patient's urine osmolality is within the normal range, and there are no casts present, which supports a diagnosis of urinary retention or urinary tract obstruction."
267,"Question: A 7-year-old boy is brought to the hospital for evaluation after being rescued from a home where he was being neglected. He was found locked in a closet and had not been fed for a month, resulting in extreme emaciation. Despite his malnutrition, the patient's cognitive function is surprisingly normal. Which of the following transport proteins is most likely responsible for preventing cognitive decline in this patient?

Options:

A. Glucose Transporter (GLUT) - This protein has a high affinity for glucose and plays a crucial role in glucose transport across cell membranes.

B. Insulin Receptor - This protein is responsive to insulin and helps regulate glucose metabolism.

C. Fructose Transporter (FRT) - This protein has a high affinity for fructose and is involved in the transport of this sugar molecule across cell membranes.

D. Facilitated Diffusion Protein - This protein helps transport glucose against its concentration gradient, ensuring that glucose reaches its target cells.

Answer: A. Glucose Transporter (GLUT)"
268,"Question: A 54-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 3-week history of intermittent swelling of his left arm and a feeling of fullness in his head that worsens upon lying down or bending over to tie his shoes. On physical examination, left-sided facial edema and distention of superficial veins in the neck and left chest wall are noted. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. Right heart failure - This condition occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, leading to fluid accumulation in the body, including the arms and head. However, the patient's symptoms of intermittent swelling and head fullness are not typical of right heart failure.

B. Cervical rib - This is a rare congenital condition where an extra rib is present in the neck, which can compress the surrounding tissues and cause symptoms such as swelling and pain in the arm and head. However, the patient's symptoms do not suggest the presence of a cervical rib.

C. Apical lung tumor - A tumor in the lung can cause symptoms such as coughing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. However, the patient's symptoms of intermittent swelling and head fullness are not typical of a lung tumor.

D. Subclavian steal syndrome - This is a rare condition where the compression of the subclavian artery can cause symptoms such as swelling and pain in the arm and hand. However, the patient's symptoms do not suggest the presence of subclavian steal syndrome.

Answer: C. Apical lung tumor - While the patient's symptoms could be caused by a variety of conditions, the most likely cause is an apical lung tumor, which is a tumor located in the upper lobe of the lung. This can cause symptoms such as coughing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing, as well as swelling and fullness in the head and arm."
269,"Question: Last night, you admitted a 72-year-old woman with severe COPD in respiratory distress. She is currently intubated and sedated, and her family is at her bedside. At the completion of morning rounds, the patient's adult son asks that you and the team take a minute to pray with him for his mother. What is the most appropriate response?

Options:

A. ""I understand what you are experiencing and am happy to take a minute.""
B. ""I also believe in the power of prayer, so I will pray with you and insist that the rest of the team joins us.""
C. ""While I cannot offer you my prayers, I will work very hard to take care of your mother.""
D. ""I don't feel comfortable praying for patients, but I will happily refer you to pastoral care.""

Answer: A. ""I understand what you are experiencing and am happy to take a minute.""

Explanation: As a healthcare provider, it's important to be sensitive to the religious and cultural beliefs of patients and their families. In this situation, the patient's adult son has requested that the team pray with him for his mother, and it's important to respect his wishes. By saying ""I understand what you are experiencing and am happy to take a minute,"" you are acknowledging the son's request and showing empathy while also being clear about your willingness to accommodate his wishes."
270,"Question: A 45-year-old woman has been experiencing worsening epigastric pain over the past month, most severe after meals and relieved with over-the-counter antacids. She denies any other symptoms or medical history of gastrointestinal malignancy. What is the best next step in her management?

Options:

A. Urease breath test: This test can help identify if the patient has a gastric infection or ulcer, which could be contributing to her symptoms.

B. Upper endoscopy with biopsy of gastric mucosa: This procedure can help identify any abnormalities in the lining of the stomach, including inflammation, ulcers, or cancer.

C. Esophageal pH monitoring: This test can measure the pH levels in the esophagus and help determine if the patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can cause similar symptoms.

D. Barium swallow: This test can help identify any abnormalities in the esophagus, including narrowing or obstruction, which could be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Answer: A. Urease breath test.

Rationale: The urease breath test can help identify if the patient has a gastric infection or ulcer, which could be contributing to her symptoms. This test involves drinking a solution containing urea, and measuring the amount of ammonia produced in the stomach. If there is an infection or ulcer in the stomach, the urea will break down and produce ammonia, which can be detected in the breath."
271,"Question: A 16-year-old female is being evaluated for shortness of breath. For the last year, she has experienced shortness of breath and subjective wheezing with exercise and intermittent coughing at night. She reports waking up from sleep coughing 1-2 times per month. She now skips gym class because of her symptoms. She denies any coughing, chest tightness, or shortness of breath on the day of her visit. On exam, her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, with a normal inspiratory to expiratory duration ratio. Her pulmonary function tests (PFTs) show normal FEV1 and FVC based on her age, gender, and height. She is told to inhale a medication, and her PFTs are repeated, now showing a FEV1 of 79% of her previous reading. The patient is diagnosed with asthma. Which of the following medications was used to diagnose the patient?

A. Methacholine

Explanation: Methacholine is a cholinergic agent that is commonly used to diagnose asthma by measuring the bronchial responsiveness to methacholine. The patient's improved FEV1 after inhaling methacholine suggests that they have bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which is a hallmark of asthma. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

B. Pilocarpine: Pilocarpine is an anticholinergic agent that is not used in the diagnosis of asthma. It does not cause bronchial constriction and therefore cannot be used to diagnose asthma.

C. Carbachol: Carbachol is a cholinergic agent that is similar to methacholine and is also used to diagnose asthma by measuring bronchial responsiveness. However, carbachol is less commonly used than methacholine due to its shorter duration of action.

D. Physostigmine: Physostigmine is an anticholinergic agent that is not used in the diagnosis of asthma. It is used to treat various neurological conditions, including myasthenia gravis, but not asthma."
272,"Question: A 28-year-old woman presents for her annual physical examination, describing a painless lump in her left breast detected during breast self-examination two weeks ago. She has no previous history of breast lumps and considers herself to be generally healthy. What is the most appropriate next step in the workup of this patient?

Options:

A. Perform an ultrasound: This is the most appropriate next step in the workup of this patient. An ultrasound can help to further evaluate the nature and extent of the mass in the patient's breast, including its size, location, and any associated blood flow or vascularity. This information can help to guide further management and determine whether a biopsy is needed.

B. Order a mammogram: While a mammogram can provide valuable information about the density and structure of the breast tissue, it may not be as useful in evaluating a small, palpable mass in the early stages of development. An ultrasound may be more appropriate in this case as it can provide more detailed information about the mass and its surrounding tissue.

C. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the breast: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide detailed information about the breast tissue and can help to evaluate the mass in the patient's breast. However, MRI may not be as sensitive as ultrasound in detecting early changes in the breast tissue, and it may not be necessary in this case.

D. Refer for an ultrasound-guided core biopsy: While a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of breast cancer, it may not be the most appropriate next step in this case. An ultrasound can provide valuable information about the mass in the patient's breast and help to guide further management. A biopsy may be considered if the ultrasound findings are concerning or if the patient has other risk factors for breast cancer."
273,"Question: A 18-month-old toddler is brought to the pediatrician by her mother for cough. The mother reports that her daughter has had a productive-sounding cough and runny nose for the past 2 days. She has also noticed that her daughter feels warm. On chart review, this is the 4th time this patient is presenting for similar concerns; the 3 previous diagnoses were otitis media (2 episodes) and bacterial sinusitis (1 episode). Her temperature is 38.3°C (101.0°F). Physical examination is notable for cough and purulent sputum from both nares, although her lungs are clear to auscultation. Sputum gram stain shows gram-positive diplococci. Serum immunoglobulin studies show normal levels of IgM and decreased levels of IgG and IgA. Which of the following is the most likely underlying diagnosis in this patient?

Options:
A. Bruton agammaglobulinemia - This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence of B cells and a deficiency of immunoglobulins, including IgG, IgA, and IgM. While Bruton agammaglobulinemia can cause recurrent respiratory infections, it is unlikely to be the underlying diagnosis in this patient given the presence of purulent sputum and gram-positive diplococci on the sputum gram stain, which are more consistent with a bacterial infection.

B. Common variable immunodeficiency - This is a common immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a variable deficiency of immunoglobulins, including IgG, IgA, and IgM. Common variable immunodeficiency can cause recurrent respiratory infections, but the presence of purulent sputum and gram-positive diplococci on the sputum gram stain suggests that the patient's infection is likely caused by a bacterial pathogen, rather than a viral pathogen, which is more commonly associated with immunodeficiency disorders.

C. Hyper-IgM syndrome - This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a high level of IgM antibodies and a deficiency of other immunoglobulins, including IgG, IgA, and IgD. Hyper-IgM syndrome can cause recurrent respiratory infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia, due to the patient's impaired ability to produce adequate levels of other immunoglobulins. The presence of purulent sputum and gram-positive diplococci on the sputum gram stain is consistent with a bacterial infection, which is more likely to occur in a patient with Hyper-IgM syndrome than in a patient with Bruton agammaglobulinemia or common variable immunodeficiency.

D. Severe combined immunodeficiency - This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a severe deficiency of T cells and B cells, which can lead to recurrent respiratory infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia. Severe combined immunodeficiency is less likely to be the underlying diagnosis in this patient given the presence of purulent sputum and gram-positive diplococci on the sputum gram stain, which are more consistent with a bacterial infection.

Answer: C. Hyper-IgM syndrome."
274,"Question: A 20-year-old woman presents with nausea, fatigue, and breast tenderness. She is sexually active with two partners and occasionally uses condoms during intercourse. A β-hCG urinary test is positive. A transvaginal ultrasound reveals an 8-week fetus in the uterine cavity. The patient is distressed by this news and requests an immediate abortion. Which of the following is the most appropriate step in management?

Options:

A. Ask the patient to reconsider and refer her to a social worker.
B. Ask the patient to obtain consent from legal guardians.
C. Explain the risk and potential harmful effects of the procedure.
D. Ask the patient to obtain consent from the baby's father.

Answer: C. Explain the risk and potential harmful effects of the procedure.

As a medical professional, it is crucial to provide the patient with accurate and comprehensive information about the abortion procedure, including the potential risks and harmful effects. This includes informing the patient about the possibility of infection, bleeding, and emotional distress, as well as the potential long-term effects on their reproductive health. By doing so, the patient can make an informed decision about their next steps, and the healthcare provider can ensure that the patient's autonomy and dignity are respected.

Asking the patient to reconsider and refer them to a social worker may not be the most appropriate step, as it does not address the immediate need for information and support. Similarly, asking the patient to obtain consent from legal guardians may not be necessary, as the patient is a competent adult and has the right to make their own decisions about their reproductive health. Asking the patient to obtain consent from the baby's father may also not be relevant, as the patient has already confirmed their desire for an abortion."
275,"Sure! Here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 34-year-old woman presents with sudden loss of vision and visual disturbances, including halos around light sources and a severe frontal headache. She has a past medical history of epilepsy and recently had her anticonvulsant medication changed, although she can't recall the name of the new medication. Upon slit-lamp examination, mild chemosis, injection, and ciliary flush with diffuse stromal haze are noted, along with shallow peripheral anterior chambers and iridocorneal touch in both eyes. Gonioscopy reveals closed angles bilaterally. Which of the following antiepileptic drugs is most likely to have caused this patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. Lamotrigine: This drug is known to cause angle-closure glaucoma, a condition that can cause sudden vision loss and visual disturbances, including halos and eye pain.

B. Topiramate: Topiramate is a common cause of angle-closure glaucoma, and can lead to sudden vision loss and visual disturbances.

C. Gabapentin: While gabapentin is not typically associated with angle-closure glaucoma, it can cause visual disturbances and eye pain in some cases.

D. Tiagabine: Tiagabine is an antiepileptic drug that can cause angle-closure glaucoma, which can lead to sudden vision loss and visual disturbances.

Answer: B. Topiramate"
276,"Question: A 54-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting. He reports feeling tired and weak for the past week without any obvious triggers. His medical history includes hypertension controlled with hydrochlorothiazide, but he denies any recent surgery, diarrhea, changes in diet, vision changes, or skin pigmentation. He does report a 10-pound weight loss, headaches, fatigue, and a chronic cough that has persisted for 2 years. He smokes 2 packs of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years but denies alcohol use. His physical examination reveals general weakness without peripheral edema. Laboratory tests are shown below:

Serum:
Na+: 120 mEq/L
Cl-: 97 mEq/L
K+: 3.4 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
Ca2+: 10 mg/dL
Osmolality: 260 mOsm/L

Urine:
Na+: 25 mEq/L
Osmolality: 285 mOsm/L
Specific gravity: 1.007

What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?

A. Chromogranin positive mass in the lung
B. Orphan Annie eyes and psammoma bodies in the thyroid
C. Pituitary hypertrophy
D. Venous congestion at the liver

Answer: A. Chromogranin positive mass in the lung

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, along with his recent weight loss, are consistent with a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The laboratory results show an elevated serum creatinine level, which is a hallmark of CKD. The patient's history of hypertension and smoking also increase his risk for developing CKD. Chromogranin A is a marker of tubular damage and is often elevated in CKD, which supports the diagnosis."
277,"Question: Thirty minutes after delivery, a 3400-g (7.5-lb) female newborn develops cyanosis of her lips and oral mucosa. She was born at 36 weeks of gestation to a 30-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios. The patient's temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 144/min, respirations are 52/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Examination shows foaming and drooling at the mouth. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. There is a harsh 3/6 systolic murmur along the left sternal border. The abdomen is soft and mildly distended. There is an anterior ectopic anus. Insertion of a nasogastric tube is attempted. An x-ray of the chest and abdomen is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. H-type tracheoesophageal fistula without esophageal atresia - This is a congenital abnormality where the trachea and esophagus do not properly separate during fetal development, resulting in a communication between the two tubes. However, there is no evidence of esophageal atresia (narrowing or closure of the esophagus) in this case.

B. Esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula to the distal esophageal segment - This is a congenital abnormality where the esophagus does not properly develop, resulting in a narrowing or closure of the esophagus, and a communication between the trachea and esophagus. The x-ray shows evidence of a distal esophageal segment, which is consistent with this diagnosis.

C. Esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula to the proximal and distal esophageal segments - This is a congenital abnormality where the esophagus does not properly develop, resulting in a narrowing or closure of the esophagus, and a communication between the trachea and esophagus in both the proximal and distal segments. The x-ray shows evidence of a distal esophageal segment, but does not provide enough information to determine the extent of the esophageal atresia.

D. Esophageal atresia without tracheoesophageal fistula - This is a congenital abnormality where the esophagus does not properly develop, resulting in a narrowing or closure of the esophagus, but without any communication between the trachea and esophagus. This diagnosis is unlikely based on the x-ray findings."
278,"Question: The 78-year-old male patient presents for a routine check-up, complaining of persistent lower extremity swelling, difficulty climbing stairs, and nocturnal breathing difficulties. He has noticed a gradual worsening of these symptoms over the past 9 months. Which medication, based on its mechanism of action, is most likely to explain the change in the patient's Starling curve from A to B as depicted in the figure?

Options:
A. Metoprolol: This medication is a beta-blocker that slows the heart rate and reduces cardiac output, which can lead to a shift in the Starling curve from A to B.
B. Furosemide: This medication is a diuretic that increases urine production, which can help reduce fluid buildup in the lower extremities and improve breathing symptoms. However, it may not directly affect the Starling curve.
C. Aspirin: This medication is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that may help reduce inflammation and swelling in the body. However, it is not directly related to the Starling curve.
D. Digoxin: This medication is a cardiac glycoside that can increase the force of the heart's contractions, leading to an increase in cardiac output and a shift in the Starling curve from A to B.

Answer: D. Digoxin."
279,"Question: A 5-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a 4-day history of fever, irritability, malaise, and left knee pain after falling off his bike 4 days ago. Examination reveals swelling and point tenderness over the medial aspect of the left knee, and an MRI shows edema of the bone marrow and destruction of the medial metaphysis of the tibia. Which of the following bacterial pathogens is most likely to be responsible for this condition?

Options:
A. Staphylococcus epidermidis
B. Staphylococcus aureus
C. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
D. Pasteurella multocida

Answer: B. Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient's symptoms of fever, irritability, and knee pain, along with the MRI findings of edema of the bone marrow and destruction of the medial metaphysis of the tibia, are consistent with a bacterial infection, particularly a staphylococcal infection. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of bacterial infections in children, particularly in the knee joint, and its presence can lead to the destruction of bone tissue. While Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can also cause knee infections, they are less likely to cause the severe destruction of bone tissue seen in this case. Pasteurella multocida is a less common cause of knee infections in children, but it can also cause destruction of bone tissue."
280,"Question: A 45-year-old obese woman presents to the office complaining of intermittent chest pain for the past 3 days. She experiences worsening pain when lying down and after meals. She also reports a bitter taste in her mouth but is otherwise in no apparent distress. She has a history of asthma, a partial hysterectomy 4 years ago, and hypothyroidism diagnosed 7 years ago. She admits to drinking 5-6 cans of beer on weekend nights. Her blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 105/min. An ECG shows no abnormal findings. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her pain?

Options:

A. Autodigestion of pancreatic tissue - This option is unlikely as there is no evidence of pancreatitis or any other pancreatic disorder.

B. Blockage of the cystic duct leading to inflammation of the wall of the gallbladder - This option is possible, as gallbladder disease can cause chest pain, especially after meals, and the patient's history of gallbladder removal does not rule out the possibility of a blockage in the cystic duct.

C. An atherosclerotic blockage of a coronary artery causing transient ischemia during times of increased cardiac demand - This option is unlikely as the patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and there is no evidence of coronary artery disease on the ECG.

D. Decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone - This option is the most likely cause of the patient's chest pain. Decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone can cause regurgitation of stomach contents into the esophagus, leading to chest pain, especially after meals. The patient's history of drinking alcohol and the bitter taste in her mouth also support this diagnosis."
281,"Question: Following a motor vehicle accident, a 63-year-old man is scheduled for surgery. The emergency physician notes a posture abnormality in the distal left lower limb and a fracture-dislocation of the right hip and acetabulum based on the radiology report. The senior orthopedic resident mistakenly notes a fraction dislocation of the left hip and marks the left hip as the site of surgery. The examination by the surgeon in the operating room shows an externally rotated and shortened left lower limb. The surgeon inserts a pin in the left tibia but erroneously operates on the left hip. A review of postoperative imaging leads to a second surgery on the fracture-dislocation of the right hip. Rather than the surgeon alone, the surgical team and the hospital system are held accountable for not implementing the mandatory protocol of preincision ‘time-out’ and compliance monitoring. Which of the following best describes this approach to prevent medical errors?

A. Closed-loop communication: This approach involves communication between different members of the healthcare team and the patient to ensure that all relevant information is shared and understood, and that any errors or discrepancies are addressed in a timely manner. However, the approach used in this scenario does not prioritize closed-loop communication as the team did not follow the mandatory protocol of preincision 'time-out' and compliance monitoring, leading to the incorrect surgical site.

B. Root cause analysis: This approach involves identifying the underlying causes of a medical error and addressing them to prevent future occurrences. While root cause analysis may be useful in identifying the underlying factors that led to the error in this scenario, it is not the best approach to describe the approach used in this case as the focus is on the systemic failure to implement protocol rather than the individual error.

C. Swiss-cheese model: This model posits that medical errors are like holes in a Swiss cheese, with multiple factors contributing to the error. The model suggests that by identifying and addressing each of the individual factors, the likelihood of errors can be reduced. In this scenario, the Swiss-cheese model is the best approach as it highlights the multiple factors that contributed to the error, including the failure of the surgical team to implement the mandatory protocol of preincision 'time-out' and compliance monitoring.

D. Sentinel event: A sentinel event is a serious adverse event that results in death or serious harm to a patient. While this scenario does involve a serious medical error, it is not a sentinel event as the error was not fatal or permanently disabling. Therefore, this option is not the best description of the approach used in this case."
282,"Question: A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because menarche has not yet occurred. She is at the 3rd percentile for height. Examination of a buccal mucosal scraping shows several cells with a single dark body attached to the nuclear membrane. Karyotyping of a neutrophil shows 45 chromosomes. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's cytogenetic abnormality?

Options:

A. Uniparental isodisomy
B. Postzygotic mitotic error
C. Robertsonian translocation
D. Reciprocal translocation

Answer: B. Postzygotic mitotic error

Explanation:
The patient's cytogenetic abnormality, characterized by several cells with a single dark body attached to the nuclear membrane, is consistent with a postzygotic mitotic error. This type of error occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy, resulting in a non-disjunction of chromosomes, leading to an abnormal number of chromosomes in the cells. In this case, the patient has 45 chromosomes, which is a common result of postzygotic mitotic error. Uniparental isodisomy, Robertsonian translocation, and reciprocal translocation are less likely causes of this patient's cytogenetic abnormality."
283,"Question: A 4-month-old boy is brought to the pediatrician for a wellness visit. Upon examination, the physician notes severe burns on the sun-exposed areas of the skin, including the face (especially the ears and nose), dorsal aspect of the hands, shoulders, and dorsal aspect of his feet. The child has very fair skin and blond hair. The parents insist that the child has not spent any extraordinary amount of time in the sun, but they admit that they rarely apply sunscreen. Which of the following physical factors is the most likely etiology for the burns?

Options:

A. Infrared radiation - This option is unlikely, as infrared radiation is not capable of causing burns on the skin.

B. Child abuse - This option is highly unlikely, as the burns are consistent with exposure to UV radiation, and there is no evidence of any other form of abuse.

C. UV-B radiation - This option is the most likely etiology for the burns, as UV-B radiation from the sun is a common cause of sunburns, especially in fair-skinned individuals like the baby.

D. Ionizing radiation - This option is not relevant to the scenario, as ionizing radiation is not capable of causing burns on the skin.

Answer: C. UV-B radiation."
284,"Question: A 67-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of fatigue, shortness of breath with exertion, and dizziness over a 4-month period. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and underwent pacemaker implantation 5 years ago following an episode of syncope. Her pulse is 66/min and blood pressure is 98/66 mm Hg. An X-ray of the chest is shown, which confirms the termination of the pacemaker lead in which of the following structures?

Options:
A. Superior vena cava
B. Left ventricle
C. Right ventricle
D. Right atrium

Answer: C. Right ventricle

Explanation: The X-ray shows the pacemaker lead terminating in the right ventricle, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath with exertion, and dizziness. The superior vena cava, left ventricle, and right atrium are not involved in the termination of the pacemaker lead."
285,"Question: A 30-year-old woman visits a clinic for a routine check-up and reports gaining 5 kg (11 lb) since her last weigh-in 3 months ago. She also complains of constipation, sensitivity to cold, and noticeable hair thinning. The patient has been using combined oral contraceptives for a few months and is compliant with the medication. During the physical examination, her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 65/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Laboratory results show:

Thyroxine (T4), total: 25 ug/dL
Thyroxine (T4), free: 0.8 ng/dL
TSH: 0.2 mU/L

Which of the following is the primary mechanism of action of the medication responsible for the patient's symptoms?

A. Inhibition of hormones in the pituitary gland
B. Inhibition of hormones in the hypothalamus
C. Increase in cervical mucus thickness
D. Induction of endometrial atrophy

Answer: A. Inhibition of hormones in the pituitary gland.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of constipation, sensitivity to cold, and noticeable hair thinning are consistent with the effects of combined oral contraceptives on the pituitary gland. Combined oral contraceptives work by inhibiting the release of hormones from the pituitary gland, which can lead to changes in metabolism, mood, and other bodily functions. In this case, the inhibition of hormones in the pituitary gland is the primary mechanism of action of the medication responsible for the patient's symptoms."
286,"Question: A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was the unrestrained driver. On arrival, she is semiconscious and incoherent. She has shortness of breath and is cyanotic. Her pulse is 112/min, respirations are 59/min, and blood pressure is 128/89 mm Hg. Examination shows a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration on the forehead and multiple abrasions over the thorax and abdomen. There is crepitation on palpation of the thorax on the right. Auscultation of the lung shows decreased breath sounds on the right side. A crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat is heard best over the precordium. There is dullness on percussion of the right hemithorax. The lips and tongue have a bluish discoloration. There is an open femur fracture on the left. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows:
pH 7.31
PCO2 55 mm Hg
PO2 42 mm Hg
HCO3- 22 mEq/L
O2 saturation 76%
The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Bronchial rupture

B. Flail chest

C. Myocardial rupture

D. Pulmonary embolism

Answer: A. Bronchial rupture

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, cyanosis, and decreased breath sounds on the right side of the chest, along with the crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat heard over the precordium, are consistent with bronchial rupture. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention to prevent respiratory failure. The other options are less likely given the patient's symptoms and examination findings."
287,"Question: A 41-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with abnormal laboratory results obtained from a recent workup. She reports that one week prior, she had lab work done as part of her company's health initiative. During the past month, she has increased her physical activity by walking 3 miles per day and has added more fruits and vegetables to her diet. Her medical history includes obesity, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She takes hydrochlorothiazide and uses a continuous positive airway pressure machine at night. Her recent lab results are as follows:

288,"Sure! Here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question:
You're eager to investigate the underlying factors contributing to heart failure reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and design a study to uncover the potential link between dietary glucose consumption and HFrEF. Which of the following study designs would enable you to establish a causal relationship between these variables?

Options:
A. Randomized controlled trial
B. Cohort study
C. Cross-sectional study
D. Case series

Answer: B. Cohort study

Explanation: A cohort study allows you to observe a group of individuals over time, tracking their dietary habits and HFrEF outcomes. By comparing individuals who consume high amounts of dietary glucose with those who consume low amounts, you can identify any potential causal relationships between the two variables. This design enables you to establish a temporal sequence of events, making it easier to determine whether changes in dietary glucose consumption precede or follow changes in HFrEF."
289,"Question: A 3400-g (7 lb 8 oz) female newborn is delivered at 40 weeks' gestation. Physical examination shows pale skin, blonde hair, and blue irides. Her parents are from Haiti and express concern regarding the newborn's appearance. The most likely cause of this newborn's condition is a defect in which of the following processes?

Options:

A. Intracellular transport of melanosomes
B. Oxidation of dihydroxyphenylalanine
C. Transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes
D. Migration of neural crest cell derivates

Answer: B. Oxidation of dihydroxyphenylalanine

Explanation: The newborn's pale skin, blonde hair, and blue irides are indicative of a condition known as OCA (oculocutaneous albinism), which is caused by a defect in the oxidation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) to melanin. This process is critical for the production of melanin, the pigment responsible for skin, hair, and eye color. A deficiency in the oxidation of DOPA leads to a decrease in melanin production, resulting in the characteristic pale skin, blonde hair, and blue irises of oculocutaneous albinism."
290,"Question: A 76-year-old man presents after an acute onset seizure. He lives in a retirement home and denies any previous history of seizures. Past medical history is significant for a hemorrhagic stroke 4 years ago, and type 2 diabetes, managed with metformin. His vital signs include: blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg, pulse 80/min, and respiratory rate 19/min. On physical examination, the patient is lethargic. Mucous membranes are dry. A noncontrast CT of the head is performed and is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:

Plasma glucose 680 mg/dL
pH 7.37
Serum bicarbonate 17 mEq/L
Effective serum osmolality 350 mOsm/kg
Urinary ketone bodies negative

Which of the following was the most likely trigger for this patient's seizure?

A. Reduced fluid intake
B. Unusual increase in physical activity
C. Metformin side effects
D. Concomitant viral infection

Answer: A. Reduced fluid intake

Rationale: The patient's elevated serum bicarbonate level (17 mEq/L) and effective serum osmolality (350 mOsm/kg) suggest that the patient may have developed hyperosmolar hyperglycemia, a complication of diabetes management. The patient's recent history of stroke and type 2 diabetes also increase the likelihood that the seizure was triggered by hyperosmolar hyperglycemia rather than other potential causes such as dehydration or infection."
291,"Question: A 32-year-old Caucasian man presents to the physician with a 3-week history of swelling and discomfort in the right testis. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Embryonal carcinoma - This is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and the ultrasound findings of an enlarged right testicle with a hypoechoic mass replacing a large portion of the normal architecture. Embryonal carcinoma is a malignant germ cell tumor that can arise in the testis and is the most common type of testicular cancer in young adults.

B. Leydig cell tumor - This is a rare type of testicular tumor that arises from the Leydig cells in the testis. It can cause symptoms similar to those of embryonal carcinoma, but the ultrasound findings are typically different.

C. Metastasis to testis - This is a possible diagnosis, but less likely given the patient's age and the absence of any history of malignancy or other underlying medical conditions.

D. Seminomatous germ cell tumor - This is a rare type of testicular cancer that is less common than embryonal carcinoma. It can cause similar symptoms and ultrasound findings, but the laboratory test results are typically different.

Answer: A. Embryonal carcinoma"
292,"Sure! Here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 25-year-old G2P1001 at 32 weeks gestation presents to the hospital with painless vaginal bleeding. The patient describes feeling a sudden sensation of her water breaking and seeing blood in her groin area while doing laundry at home. Although she hasn't seen an obstetrician in 14 weeks, her prenatal history is unremarkable according to clinic records. Her previous delivery was an urgent cesarean section due to placenta previa. Her vital signs are: temperature, 95°F (35°C); blood pressure, 125/75 mmHg; pulse, 79/min; respirations, 18/min; and oxygen saturation, 98% on room air. Cervical exam reveals gross blood in the vaginal os. Fetal head is not palpable. Fetal heart rate monitoring shows decelerations and bradycardia. Labs are pending. IV fluids are initiated. What is the best next step in management?

Options:
A. Betamethasone
B. Cesarean section

D. Red blood cell transfusion

Answer: B. Cesarean section"
293,"Question: A 15-year-old male presents with his father to the urgent care with 5 days of persistent diarrhea, occasionally with streaks of blood mixed in. Stool cultures are pending, but preliminary stool samples reveal fecal leukocytes and erythrocytes. His vital signs are as follows: blood pressure is 126/83 mm Hg, heart rate is 97/min, and respiratory rate is 15/min. He is started on outpatient therapy for presumed Shigella infection. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?

Options:

A. IV erythromycin
B. Oral vancomycin
C. Oral doxycycline
D. Oral TMP-SMX

Answer: D. Oral TMP-SMX

Rationale: Shigella infections are typically treated with antibiotics that cover both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. TMP-SMX, a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, is an effective treatment for Shigella infections and is available in oral form. IV erythromycin, oral vancomycin, and oral doxycycline are not the most appropriate treatments for Shigella infections."
294,"Question: An anesthesiologist is preparing a patient for a brief surgical procedure. The physician would like to select a sedating agent that can be administered intravenously and will have a prompt onset of action and short half-life. Which of the following agents would be perfect for this purpose?

Options:
A. Succinylcholine
B. Hydromorphone
C. Sodium thiopental
D. Lidocaine

Answer: C. Sodium thiopental.

Sodium thiopental is an ultra-short-acting barbiturate that is frequently used for sedation and anesthesia. It has a rapid onset of action, with sedation developing in as little as 30 seconds, and a short half-life of approximately 3-5 minutes. This makes it an ideal choice for a brief surgical procedure, as it can provide quick and effective sedation without lingering in the body for an extended period. Additionally, sodium thiopental is generally well-tolerated and has a low risk of respiratory depression, making it a safe choice for patients undergoing short surgical procedures."
295,"Question: A 53-year-old man presents to your office with a 2-month history of abdominal bloating. He experiences feeling full after eating only a small amount and has experienced bloating, diarrhea, and occasionally vomiting when he tries to eat large amounts. He states that his diarrhea has become more profuse and is altering the quality of his life. One week ago, the patient was given antibiotics for an ear infection. He states he is trying to eat more healthy and has replaced full-fat dairy with fat-free dairy and is reducing his consumption of meat. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 164/99 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Laboratory values from a previous office visit are notable for a hemoglobin A1c of 13%. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient's diarrhea?

A. Elimination of dairy from the diet
B. Metoclopramide
C. Rifaximin
D. Vancomycin

Answer: C. Rifaximin

Rifaximin is the best treatment for this patient's diarrhea due to its effectiveness in treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is the likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. IBS is characterized by abdominal bloating, changes in bowel habits, and abdominal pain, which are all consistent with the patient's symptoms. Rifaximin is an antibiotic that has been shown to improve symptoms of IBS by reducing the amount of bacteria in the gut and altering the gut microbiome. Elimination of dairy from the diet may help alleviate symptoms in some patients with IBS, but it is not a proven treatment for this condition. Metoclopramide is a medication that can help reduce symptoms of diarrhea, but it is not specifically approved for the treatment of IBS. Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat infections, but it is not effective in treating IBS or diarrhea."
296,"Question: A 32-year-old woman presents to the physician with a 2-month history of fatigue, muscle weakness, paresthesias, headache, and palpitations. Her pulse is 75/min and blood pressure is 152/94 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities. Serum studies show:

297,"Question: A 68-year-old man presents with complaints of breathlessness and a dry cough that have been progressive over several months. He is able to perform his daily tasks, but feels less efficient than before. His vital signs are normal, with a pulse of 87 beats per minute and blood pressure of 135/88 mmHg. Auscultation of the chest reveals bilateral basal inspiratory crackles. A chest X-ray shows peripheral reticular opacities with a coarse reticular pattern, and a high-resolution CT scan reveals patchy bibasilar reticular opacities. Which of the following medications is most likely to be responsible for this patient's condition?

Options:
A. Amiodarone: This medication is known to cause pulmonary fibrosis and reticular opacities on chest imaging, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms and findings.
B. Lidocaine: Lidocaine is not associated with pulmonary fibrosis or reticular opacities, and is not a likely cause of the patient's condition.
C. Sotalol: Sotalol can cause pulmonary fibrosis and reticular opacities, but the patient's symptoms and findings are more consistent with amiodarone toxicity.
D. Verapamil: Verapamil is not associated with pulmonary fibrosis or reticular opacities, and is not a likely cause of the patient's condition.

Answer: A. Amiodarone."
298,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 15-day-old girl visits the pediatrician for a well-baby checkup. Her mother reports that the baby has been exclusively breastfeeding since birth, feeding on demand every one to two hours for 10-15 minutes on each breast. The mother notices that the baby sleeps for longer stretches of three hours once or twice a day, and wonders if she should be waking the baby up to feed during those times. Additionally, the mother sometimes feels that her breasts are not completely empty after feeding. The baby voids 4-5 times per day and stools 2-3 times per day. During the first week of life, the mother noticed red streaks in the baby's diaper. The baby was born at 39 weeks gestation via a vaginal delivery, and weighed 2787 g (6 lb 2 oz, 16th percentile) at birth. One week ago, the baby weighed 2588 g (5 lb 11 oz, 8th percentile), and today the baby weighs 2720 g (6 lb, 8th percentile). The baby's temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 52/41 mmHg, pulse is 177/min, and respirations are 32/min. The baby has normal cardiac sounds, abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended.

What is the best next step in management?

A) Observe the baby during a feeding
B) Recommend modifications to the mother's diet
C) Recommend waking the baby to feed
D) Supplement breastfeeding with conventional formula

Answer: A) Observe the baby during a feeding"
299,"Question: A 26-day-old newborn presents with poor feeding and lethargy for 2 weeks, accompanied by a raspy cry. Examination reveals scleral icterus, an enlarged tongue, distended abdomen, and a soft, reducible mass at the umbilicus. The child's vital signs are within normal limits. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is:

A. Thyroid dysgenesis: Thyroid dysgenesis is a congenital disorder characterized by abnormal development of the thyroid gland. The symptoms of poor feeding, lethargy, and raspy cry are consistent with hypothyroidism, which can occur in thyroid dysgenesis.

B. Acid maltase deficiency: Acid maltase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the breakdown of complex carbohydrates. The symptoms of poor feeding, lethargy, and distended abdomen are consistent with this disorder.

C. Trisomy 21: Trisomy 21, also known as Down syndrome, is a genetic disorder caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. The symptoms of poor feeding, lethargy, and distended abdomen are common in infants with Trisomy 21.

D. Chromosome 11p alteration: A chromosome 11p alteration is a rare genetic disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including poor feeding, lethargy, and distended abdomen.

Answer: A. Thyroid dysgenesis"
300,"Question:

Six days after undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of a left-sided femur fracture, a 67-year-old man experiences sudden-onset severe pain and paresthesia in his right arm. What is the most likely explanation for his current symptoms?

Options:

A. Peripheral arterial disease
B. Adverse effect of medication
C. Atrial fibrillation
D. Disseminated intravascular coagulation

Answer: B. Adverse effect of medication

The patient's sudden-onset severe pain and paresthesia in his right arm after six days of uneventful surgery and postoperative course suggest an adverse effect of medication. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of a capillary refill time of 6 seconds, decreased brachial and radial pulses, and pale and cold skin over the right arm also support this diagnosis. The other options, peripheral arterial disease, atrial fibrillation, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms based on the given information."
301,"Question: A 71-year-old man seeks routine health maintenance examination. He has a 3-year history of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and his symptoms of urinary hesitancy and terminal dribbling of urine are well controlled with tamsulosin and finasteride. He also had a percutaneous coronary angioplasty 2 years ago for unstable angina. His medication list includes aspirin, atorvastatin, losartan, and nitroglycerin. His vital signs are within normal limits. He has never had a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test or prostate ultrasonography. Which screening test is most appropriate for prostate cancer in this patient?

A. Annual prostate ultrasonography
B. Annual serum PSA testing
C. Every 2-4 years serum PSA testing
D. No screening test is recommended

Answer: D. No screening test is recommended

Rationale:

The patient has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia, which increases the risk of developing prostate cancer. However, the patient has never had a PSA test or prostate ultrasonography, which are the recommended screening tests for prostate cancer. Given the patient's age and medical history, it is appropriate to recommend no screening test for prostate cancer at this time.

Option A, annual prostate ultrasonography, is not recommended as the patient has never had a PSA test or prostate ultrasonography, and there is no indication for routine screening in the absence of a history of prostate cancer or abnormal PSA levels.

Option B, annual serum PSA testing, is also not recommended as the patient has never had a PSA test or prostate ultrasonography, and there is no indication for routine screening in the absence of a history of prostate cancer or abnormal PSA levels.

Option C, every 2-4 years serum PSA testing, is also not recommended as there is no indication for routine screening in the absence of a history of prostate cancer or abnormal PSA levels.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is option D, no screening test is recommended."
302,"Question: A 22-year-old female presents at 24 weeks gestation with a chief complaint of burning upon urination. On physical exam, you note a gravid uterus that extends above the umbilicus. A urine analysis and culture is sent demonstrating over 100,000 colony forming units of E. coli. Of note, this patient had a similar UTI 7 weeks ago that was resolved with appropriate medication. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient?

Options:

A. Nitrofurantoin
B. Cephalexin
C. Nitrofurantoin and continue with nitrofurantoin prophylaxis for the rest of the pregnancy
D. Cephalexin and IV antibiotic prophylaxis for the rest of the pregnancy

Answer: C. Nitrofurantoin and continue with nitrofurantoin prophylaxis for the rest of the pregnancy

Rationale:

The patient has had a previous UTI at 17 weeks gestation, which was resolved with appropriate antibiotics. Given the recurrence of the infection at 24 weeks gestation, it is important to manage the infection and prevent future recurrences. Nitrofurantoin is an effective antibiotic for the treatment and prevention of UTIs during pregnancy, and continuing nitrofurantoin prophylaxis for the rest of the pregnancy is the most appropriate management for this patient.

Nitrofurantoin is a first-line agent for the treatment and prevention of UTIs during pregnancy, as it is well-tolerated and has been shown to be effective in preventing recurrent UTIs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends the use of nitrofurantoin prophylaxis for pregnant women with a history of recurrent UTIs.

Cephalexin is an alternative antibiotic that can be used to treat UTIs during pregnancy, but it may not be as effective as nitrofurantoin in preventing recurrent infections. Additionally, Cephalexin may have a higher risk of side effects in pregnant women, including diarrhea and allergic reactions.

Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient is to continue nitrofurantoin prophylaxis for the rest of the pregnancy to prevent future recurrences of UTIs."
303,"Question: A 78-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. Which blood vessel contributes the most to the delivery of blood to the affected area?

Options:
A. Sigmoid arteries
B. Internal pudendal artery
C. Left colic artery
D. Superior rectal artery

Answer: C. Left colic artery.

The left colic artery is the main blood vessel that supplies blood to the descending colon, which is the area affected in this case of ischemic colitis. The sigmoid arteries, internal pudendal artery, and superior rectal artery are smaller vessels that supply smaller segments of the colon, but they are not the primary vessels responsible for delivering blood to the affected area in this case."
304,"Question: A 31-year-old woman presents with dysuria and lower abdominal pain, a symptom she has never experienced before. She has no history of genitourinary or gynecological diseases. Her vital signs are within normal limits, and the physical examination is normal. A urine culture grows the pathogens pictured. Which of the following factors specifically allows these pathogens to cause urinary tract infections?

Options:

A. P-fimbriae: These are small, hair-like structures that allow the bacteria to attach to the bladder wall and cause infection.
B. K-capsule: The K-capsule is a protein structure that helps the bacteria evade the host's immune system and cause infection.
C. Heat-stable toxin: This toxin is produced by some bacteria and can cause inflammation and damage to the bladder wall, leading to infection.
D. Hemolysin: This toxin is produced by some bacteria and can cause damage to red blood cells, leading to infection.

Answer: A. P-fimbriae."
305,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 61-year-old man with longstanding diabetes and coronary artery disease presents to the emergency room with chest pain and shortness of breath. An echocardiogram reveals moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 27%. A chest X-ray shows bibasilar infiltrates. The physician adds a new drug to his medication regimen and informs him of possible side effects such as urinary frequency, increased breast tissue development, and erectile dysfunction. What is the mechanism of action of this drug?

Options:

A. Inhibits beta-adrenergic receptors to decrease SA node conduction velocity
B. Inhibits epithelial Na-channels on the cortical collecting duct
C. Inhibits mineralocorticoid receptor on the cortical collecting duct
D. Inhibits Na-Cl symporter on the distal convoluted tubule

Answer: C. Inhibits mineralocorticoid receptor on the cortical collecting duct.

Explanation: The drug in question is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, which means it blocks the action of mineralocorticoids on the cortical collecting duct. Mineralocorticoids are hormones produced by the adrenal gland that help regulate electrolyte balance and blood pressure. By blocking the action of mineralocorticoids, this drug can help reduce the development of fluid retention and edema in the body, which can be beneficial for patients with heart failure. However, it can also cause side effects such as urinary frequency and increased breast tissue development due to the inhibition of mineralocorticoid receptors in other tissues."

307,"Question: A 73-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her son due to a 2-month history of diarrhea and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. Her son reports that she frequently trips over the nightstand when getting up to use the bathroom at night. She is 173 cm tall and weighs 54 kg; her BMI is 18 kg/m2. Physical examination reveals dry skin, multiple bruises on the shins, and triangular keratin plaques on the temporal half of the conjunctiva. Which of the following deficiencies is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?

Options:

A. Retinol - This deficiency can cause dry skin and bruising, as well as changes in the conjunctiva, such as triangular keratin plaques.

B. Zinc - Zinc deficiency can cause immune system dysfunction, leading to recurrent infections.

C. Riboflavin - Riboflavin deficiency can cause changes in the conjunctiva, including triangular keratin plaques.

D. Niacin - Niacin deficiency can cause skin changes, including dryness and bruising.

Answer: A. Retinol"
308,"Question: A mutant stem cell was created by using an inducible RNAi system, such that when doxycycline is added, the siRNA targeting DNA helicase is expressed, effectively knocking down the gene for DNA helicase. Which of the following will occur during DNA replication?

Options:
A. DNA is not unwound - This option is correct. When DNA helicase is knocked down, DNA replication is unable to initiate, as DNA unwinding is the first step in the replication process.
B. DNA supercoiling is not relieved - This option is incorrect. DNA supercoiling is not directly related to DNA replication, so its relaxation or unwinding does not affect the process.
C. The two melted DNA strands reanneal - This option is incorrect. When DNA helicase is knocked down, the two melted DNA strands are unable to reanneal, as the lack of DNA helicase activity prevents the strands from being brought back together.
D. The RNA primer is not created - This option is incorrect. The RNA primer is not directly affected by the knockdown of DNA helicase, as it is formed through a separate process during DNA replication.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) DNA is not unwound."
309,"Question: A 1-year-old boy is brought to the physician due to irritability and poor feeding that started 2 days ago. The mother reports that he has been crying more than usual during this time and has not taken in any food or water since that morning. The boy has not vomited, but when his lower abdomen is palpated, he cries. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 116/min, and blood pressure is 98/54 mm Hg. He was born at term and has been healthy. He appears ill. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Perform renal ultrasound
B. Obtain a clean-catch urine sample
C. Perform transurethral catheterization
D. Administer cefixime

Answer: C. Perform transurethral catheterization

Rationale: The boy's symptoms of irritability, poor feeding, and refusal to drink or urinate suggest a possible case of urinary tract infection (UTI). The mother's report of a strong-smelling, pink-colored urine and the boy's crying when the lower abdomen is palpated further support this diagnosis. Given the boy's age and the presence of these symptoms, it is important to perform a urinalysis to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other underlying conditions. Transurethral catheterization is the most appropriate next step in management, as it allows for direct measurement of the boy's urine output and can help to identify any signs of UTI. While renal ultrasound may be useful in some cases of UTI, it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario as it is not specific to urinary tract infections and may not be able to detect any signs of infection in the early stages. Obtaining a clean-catch urine sample may also be helpful in diagnosing UTI, but it may not be as effective as transurethral catheterization in detecting early signs of infection. Administering cefixime, a common antibiotic used to treat UTIs, may be considered as a next step in management, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario as the diagnosis has not been confirmed through urinalysis."
310,"Question:

An 8-year-old boy presents to the physician with persistent sickness and clumsiness, accompanied by multiple episodes of pneumonia and diarrhea. He also reports difficulty seeing in low light environments. Additional symptoms include white patches on the sclerotic coat and conjunctival dryness. What is the likely cause of these symptoms in this child?

Options:

A. Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1
B. Autoimmune neutropenia
C. Deficiency of vitamin A
D. Congenital rubella

Answer: C. Deficiency of vitamin A.

The child's symptoms of persistent sickness, clumsiness, and difficulty seeing in low light environments are consistent with a deficiency of vitamin A. The white patches on the sclerotic coat and conjunctival dryness are also indicative of vitamin A deficiency. While SCA type 1, autoimmune neutropenia, and congenital rubella could also potentially cause these symptoms, a deficiency of vitamin A is the most likely explanation for the child's condition."
311,"Question: Which of the following patient presentations would be expected in an infant with defective LFA-1 integrin (CD18) protein on phagocytes, in addition to recurrent bacterial infections?

Options:

A. Eczema and thrombocytopenia
B. Skin infections with absent pus formation, delayed umbilicus separation
C. Cardiac defects, hypoparathyroidism, palatal defects, and learning disabilities
D. Chronic diarrhea, oral candidiasis, severe infections since birth, absent thymic shadow

Answer: B. Skin infections with absent pus formation, delayed umbilicus separation.

Explanation: Defective LFA-1 integrin (CD18) protein on phagocytes can lead to impaired phagocytosis and recurrent bacterial infections. In addition to recurrent bacterial infections, an infant with defective LFA-1 integrin may also present with skin infections that lack pus formation and delayed umbilicus separation. This is because the impaired phagocytosis can lead to a defect in the normal healing process, resulting in absent pus formation and delayed separation of the umbilical stump."
312,"Question: A 21-year-old woman presents to the clinic concerned about a possible pregnancy. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago, and she reports having unprotected sex with her boyfriend despite not feeling sexually desire. They have since broken up, and she wants to take a pregnancy test. She appears very thin but is physically active, spending several hours in the gym each day. Her calculated BMI is 17 kg/m2, and her urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following additional findings would most likely be present in this patient?

Options:

A. Orthostasis - This patient's extreme thinness and physical activity suggest that she may have orthostatic intolerance, which can cause lightheadedness or fainting when standing up.

B. Primary amenorrhea - The patient's lack of menstruation despite being sexually active and not using contraception suggests that she may have primary amenorrhea, a condition where the menstrual cycle does not occur.

C. Hypocholesterolemia - The patient's thinness and high physical activity may indicate low levels of cholesterol in the blood, which can lead to muscle weakness and fatigue.

D. Hypokalemic alkalosis - The patient's extreme thinness and high physical activity may cause an imbalance in potassium levels in the body, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Answer: A. Orthostasis"
313,"Question:

These specialized T cells play a crucial role in immunological tolerance by regulating the activation of self-reactive lymphocytes. They typically develop in the thymus, but some also form in peripheral lymphoid organs. They are usually CD4+ and express the CD25 molecule. Their functions are dependent on forkhead box P3 (Foxp3). Which interleukin is secreted by these cells to regulate the activation of self-reactive lymphocytes?

314,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe retrosternal chest pain and shortness of breath that started the day before. He also has a sore throat and neck pain that has persisted for the past 4 days. He has been bed-bound during this time and has poor appetite. One week ago, he underwent an upper endoscopy for peptic ulcer disease. He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcer disease, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, and is currently taking omeprazole. He is in significant distress, with a temperature of 39.1°C (102.3°F), pulse of 108/min, respirations of 28/min, and blood pressure of 88/46 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation, cardiac examination reveals tachycardia, and the abdomen is soft and nontender. Oropharyngeal examination is limited due to pain. His hematocrit is 42%, leukocyte count is 13,800/mm3, and platelet count is 205,000/mm3. He is intubated in the emergency department and appropriate treatment is initiated. A chest x-ray reveals a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is most likely to have caused this patient's condition?

Options:
A. Pericardiocentesis
B. Intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam administration
C. Blood pressure control
D. Intravenous levofloxacin administration

Answer: B. Intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam administration"
315,"Question: A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a complaint of intense pain in his right foot for the past month, along with fever and chills. He denies any traumatic injury to his foot in recent memory. He has a medical history of poorly-controlled type II diabetes and is a former smoker with extensive peripheral vascular disease. On physical exam, the area of his right foot around the hallux is swollen, erythematous, tender to light palpation, and reveals exposed bone. Labs are notable for elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The physician obtains a biopsy for culture. What is the most likely causative organism for this patient's condition?

Options:

A. Mycobacterium tuberculosis - This organism is a common cause of bacterial infections in the body, particularly in areas with poor circulation or immune compromise. However, the patient's history of poorly-controlled diabetes and peripheral vascular disease increases the likelihood of a different organism causing the infection.

B. Neisseria gonorrhoeae - While gonorrhea can cause skin infections, it is less likely to cause the severe symptoms and signs presented by the patient in this scenario.

C. Pasteurella multocida - This organism can cause bacterial infections in the skin and soft tissues, including cellulitis. However, it is less likely to cause the exposed bone and severe symptoms observed in the patient.

D. Staphylococcus aureus - This organism is a common cause of skin infections, including cellulitis, and is often associated with poor circulation and immune compromise. The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and the presence of exposed bone on physical exam support this diagnosis.

Answer: D. Staphylococcus aureus."
316,"Sure! Here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 45-year-old woman visits her primary care physician for her annual checkup. She feels well and has no complaints, but mentions that she has been experiencing symmetrical pain in her hands that changes color from red to white to blue and back to normal. She also reveals that she smokes one cigarette per day and drinks two alcoholic beverages per night. During the physical examination, bilateral edema is noticed in her extremities. Which of the following is the best course of action?

Options:
A. Compression stockings: These stockings can help reduce swelling in the legs and arms, which could be helpful in managing the patient's edema.
B. Furosemide: This medication is a diuretic that can help reduce fluid buildup in the body, which could also help manage the patient's edema.
C. Increase current medication dose: The patient's hypertension may be contributing to the edema in her extremities, so increasing the dose of her current medication could be a potential solution.
D. Lisinopril: This medication is an ACE inhibitor that can help reduce blood pressure and fluid buildup in the body, which could help manage the patient's edema.

Answer: D. Lisinopril."
317,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: An elderly man of 66 years of age is brought into the emergency department by his daughter due to a sudden change in behavior. He was more confused than usual and kept repeating the same questions, which has not improved over the past 24 hours. Last year, he suffered a series of falls that led to a decline in his ability to care for himself, including being unable to cook or pay his bills. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, hypertension, depression, diabetes mellitus type II, constipation, diverticulitis, and peripheral neuropathy. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, sodium docusate, atorvastatin, metoprolol, fluoxetine, and gabapentin. On examination, you find a confused patient who is poorly kept, with bruises on his legs and an unstable gait. He is alert to person and place, but answers some questions inappropriately. His vital signs show a pulse of 90 beats per minute and blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms?

Their primary focus is on the 20th week of gestation, during which the terminal bronchioles differentiate into respiratory bronchioles and further into alveolar ducts. Which stage of embryonic lung development are scientists primarily interested in studying?

Options:
A. Embryonic
B. Pseudoglandular
C. Canalicular
D. Saccular

Answer: C. Canalicular"
319,"Question: A 30-year-old patient presents to the emergency room with a chief complaint of left chest pain, productive cough with purulent sputum for 1 week, and shortness of breath. He had previously been diagnosed with influenza but did not follow the doctor's instructions. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Sarcoidosis
B. Pneumonia
C. Lung cancer
D. Tuberculosis

Answer: B. Pneumonia

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms of left chest pain, productive cough with purulent sputum, and shortness of breath are consistent with pneumonia. The fact that the patient had previously been diagnosed with influenza but did not follow the doctor's instructions suggests that they may have developed a secondary bacterial infection, such as pneumonia. The findings of the hemogram and chest X-ray also support this diagnosis, as there is an elevated white blood cell count and alveolar infiltrates in the left base with air bronchograms, both of which are common findings in pneumonia. Sarcoidosis, lung cancer, and tuberculosis are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results."
320,"Question: A 47-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after coughing up 2 cups of bright red blood. A CT angiogram of the chest shows active extravasation from the right bronchial artery. A coil embolization is planned to stop the bleeding. During this procedure, a catheter is first inserted into the right femoral artery. Which of the following represents the correct subsequent order of the catheter route?

Options:
A. Thoracic aorta, right subclavian artery, right internal thoracic artery, right bronchial artery
B. Thoracic aorta, right posterior intercostal artery, right bronchial artery
C. Thoracic aorta, right superior epigastric artery, right bronchial artery
D. Thoracic aorta, left ventricle, left atrium, pulmonary artery, right bronchial artery

Answer: B. Thoracic aorta, right posterior intercostal artery, right bronchial artery

Explanation:
During a coil embolization procedure, the catheter is first inserted into the right femoral artery, which is a peripheral artery located in the leg. From there, the catheter is advanced through the aorta and into the right bronchial artery, which is located in the chest cavity. The correct subsequent order of the catheter route is therefore:

1. Thoracic aorta
2. Right posterior intercostal artery
3. Right bronchial artery

Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not represent the correct order of the catheter route during a coil embolization procedure."
321,"Question: Two hours into recovery from general anesthesia for an orthopedic fracture, a 34-year-old woman develops fever and masseter muscle rigidity with lockjaw. She has no prior history of similar episodes, takes no medications, and appears confused. In the recovery room, her blood pressure is 78/50 mm Hg, pulse is 128/min, respirations are 42/min, and temperature is 40.3°C (104.5°F). Cardiopulmonary examination reveals no abnormalities. Laboratory tests show:
Serum Na+: 145 mEq/L
K+: 6.5 mEq/L
Arterial blood gas on room air:
pH: 7.01
PCO2: 78 mm Hg
HCO3−: 14 mEq/L
PO2: 55 mm Hg
The patient is reintubated. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy?

A. Cyproheptadine
B. Dantrolene
C. Labetalol
D. Lorazepam

Answer: B. Dantrolene

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of fever and masseter muscle rigidity with lockjaw are consistent with a diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia, a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur in response to anesthesia. Dantrolene is a specific treatment for malignant hyperthermia and is given intravenously in a dose of 1-2 mg/kg. It works by inhibiting the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which can help to reduce muscle rigidity and prevent further muscle damage. Cyproheptadine, Lorazepam, and Labetalol are not appropriate treatments for malignant hyperthermia."
322,"Question: A 36-year-old man presents to the physician with a 4-week history of swollen legs, difficulty putting on socks due to the swelling, and a previous diagnosis of sleep apnea. He is 171 cm tall and weighs 115 kg, with a BMI of 39 kg/m2. His vital signs show a pulse of 91/min and blood pressure of 135/82 mm Hg, with periorbital and bilateral lower extremity edema noted during examination. Which of the following is most likely to be observed under light microscopy of the patient's renal biopsy specimen?

A. Segmental sclerosis of the glomeruli: This is the most likely option, as segmental sclerosis of the glomeruli is a common finding in patients with nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by the loss of large amounts of protein in the urine. The patient's swollen legs and difficulty putting on socks suggest that they have nephrotic syndrome, and the segmental sclerosis of the glomeruli is a likely cause of this condition.

B. Fibrin crescents within the glomerular space: Fibrin crescents are a characteristic feature of active membranous nephropathy, a kidney disease that can cause nephrotic syndrome. However, the patient's history of sleep apnea and the absence of other symptoms such as hematuria or proteinuria suggest that membranous nephropathy is less likely to be the cause of their nephrotic syndrome.

C. Diffuse thickening of glomerular capillaries: Diffuse thickening of glomerular capillaries is a finding that can be seen in a number of kidney diseases, including minimal change disease and membranous nephropathy. However, as mentioned earlier, the patient's history of sleep apnea and the absence of other symptoms suggest that membranous nephropathy is less likely to be the cause of their nephrotropic syndrome.

D. Amyloid deposition in the mesangium: Amyloid deposition in the mesangium is a characteristic feature of primary amyloidosis, a rare kidney disease that can cause nephrotic syndrome. However, the patient's history of sleep apnea and the absence of other symptoms suggest that primary amyloidosis is also less likely to be the cause of their nephrotic syndrome."
323,"Question: A patient is hospitalized for pneumonia. Gram-positive cocci in clusters are seen on sputum gram stain. Which of the following clinical scenarios is most commonly associated with this form of pneumonia?

Options:

A. HIV positive adult with a CD4 count less than 150 and an impaired diffusion capacity
B. An otherwise healthy young adult with a week of mild fatigue, chills, and cough
C. Hospitalized adult with development of pneumonia symptoms 2 weeks following a viral illness
D. An alcoholic with evidence of empyema and ""currant jelly sputum""

Answer: C. Hospitalized adult with development of pneumonia symptoms 2 weeks following a viral illness.

Explanation: The presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters on a sputum gram stain is consistent with pneumococcal pneumonia, which is most commonly seen in hospitalized adults who have developed pneumonia symptoms 2 weeks following a viral illness. This is because pneumococcal pneumonia is more likely to occur in individuals who have a weakened immune system, such as those with a viral illness, and can be caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae. The other options are less likely to be associated with this form of pneumonia."
324,"Question: A 4-year-old male is brought to the emergency room with dyspnea and fever. His mother reports a two-day history of progressive shortness of breath, malaise, and a fever with a maximum temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C). The child has visited the emergency room three times over the past two years for pneumonia and otitis media. His family history is notable for sarcoidosis in his mother, diabetes in his father, and an early childhood death in his maternal uncle. His temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), blood pressure is 110/90 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 24/min. Physical examination reveals scant lymphoid tissue. A serological analysis reveals decreased levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM. This patient most likely has a defect in a protein that is active in which of the following cellular stages?

A. Pro-B-cell
B. Pre-B-cell
C. Immature B-cell
D. Mature B-cell

Answer: B. Pre-B-cell

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and fever, along with the history of recurrent infections, suggest that the patient's immune system is not functioning properly. The serological analysis showing decreased levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM suggests that there is a defect in the patient's immune system, specifically in the B-cell lineage.

The Pre-B-cell stage is the earliest stage of B-cell development, and it is characterized by the expression of the Pre-B-cell marker CD10. The patient's Pre-B-cell stage is likely defective, leading to the decreased levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM.

Therefore, the answer is B. Pre-B-cell."
325,"Question: An investigator conducts a case-control study to evaluate the relationship between benzodiazepine use among the elderly population (older than 65 years of age) that resides in assisted-living facilities and the risk of developing Alzheimer dementia. Three hundred patients with Alzheimer dementia are recruited from assisted-living facilities throughout the New York City metropolitan area, and their rates of benzodiazepine use are compared to 300 controls. Which of the following describes a patient who would be appropriate for the study's control group?

Options:

A. An 80-year-old man with well-controlled hypertension and mild benign prostate hyperplasia who lives in an independent-living community - This patient would not be appropriate for the control group, as they do not reside in an assisted-living facility, which is the specific population of interest in the study.

B. A 64-year-old man with well-controlled hypertension and mild benign prostate hyperplasia who lives in an assisted-living facility - This patient is appropriate for the control group, as they reside in an assisted-living facility, which is the population of interest in the study.

C. A 73-year-old woman with coronary artery disease who was recently discharged to an assisted-living facility from the hospital after a middle cerebral artery stroke - This patient would not be appropriate for the control group, as they have a recent history of coronary artery disease and a recent stroke, which may affect their cognitive function and make it difficult to compare them to the patients with Alzheimer dementia.

D. A 86-year-old man with well-controlled hypertension and mild benign prostate hyperplasia who lives in an assisted-living facility - This patient is appropriate for the control group, as they reside in an assisted-living facility and have well-controlled hypertension and mild benign prostate hyperplasia, which are similar to the characteristics of the patients with Alzheimer dementia in the study."
326,"Question: A 12-year-old male presents to the pediatrician with tea-colored urine and reports feeling quick and excessively fatigued during junior high football practice. He refused to return to practice due to humiliation by other players. A blood test revealed elevated creatine kinase and myoglobulin levels, and a muscle biopsy showed large glycogen deposits with lack of myophosphorylase activity. Which of the following reactions is not occurring in this individual?

Options:

A. Converting glucose-6-phosphate to glucose
B. Breaking down glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate
C. Cleaving alpha-1,6 glycosidic bonds from glycogen
D. Converting galactose to galactose-1-phosphate

Answer: D. Converting galactose to galactose-1-phosphate.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, a condition characterized by the breakdown of muscle tissue. Rhabdomyolysis can occur due to various causes, including muscle injury, infection, and drug toxicity. In this case, the patient's rapid fatigability and elevated muscle enzymes indicate that the muscle tissue is being broken down, leading to the release of myoglobin and creatine kinase into the bloodstream.

Option D, converting galactose to galactose-1-phosphate, is not a reaction occurring in this individual, as there is no evidence of galactose metabolism or abnormalities in the muscle tissue. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
327,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 29-year-old primigravid woman at 18 weeks' gestation visits her physician for her first prenatal appointment. She works as a paralegal and lives with her husband. The pregnancy was unplanned, and she did not take any prenatal medications or supplements. During the physical examination, the uterus is found to be 2 inches above the umbilicus. Laboratory tests reveal elevated levels of α-fetoprotein in the maternal serum and both α-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase in the amniotic fluid. An ultrasound of the uterus shows an increased amniotic fluid volume. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis for the fetus is:
A. Holoprosencephaly
B. Lissencephaly
C. Myelomeningocele
D. Anencephaly

Answer: D. Anencephaly"
328,"Question: A 77-year-old female patient visits a free clinic for follow-up examination after a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was previously treated in an emergency department two weeks ago, where she presented with altered mental state and dysuria. The medical student, who is seeing the patient, recently read a study that found a strong relationship between cognitive impairment and UTI hospitalization risk (RR = 1.34, p < 0.001). The attending physician at the clinic, who is familiar with the study, tells the medical student that the results should be interpreted with caution. Which of the following concerns is most likely underlying the attending physician's remarks?

A. Low internal validity
B. Poor reliability
C. Low external validity
D. Selection bias

Answer: C. Low external validity

Explanation: The attending physician's remarks suggest that the study may not be applicable to the patient population being seen at the free clinic, which serves largely uninsured low-income patients in a New York City neighborhood with a large African American and Latino population. The study was conducted in a sample of upper middle class Caucasian patients in the Netherlands, which may not be representative of the patient population at the clinic. Therefore, the results of the study may not be generalizable to the population being seen at the clinic, and the attending physician is cautioning the medical student to interpret the study results with this in mind."
329,"Question: A 4-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of breathlessness, which has been progressively worsening over the past week. Her symptoms are worse during the day when playing in the garden with siblings, and she improves indoors. She complains of difficulty breathing and gasping for air, and her parents report a noisy wheeze while breathing. Examination reveals distress and intercostal retractions. What is the most likely mechanism responsible for this child's breathing difficulties?

A. Destruction of bronchial wall elastic layers leading to abnormal dilation
B. Defective chloride channel function causing mucus plugging
C. Inflammation leading to alveolar destruction and permanent dilation
D. Airway hyperreactivity to external allergens causing intermittent airway obstruction

Answer: D. Airway hyperreactivity to external allergens causing intermittent airway obstruction. This mechanism is the most likely explanation for the child's breathing difficulties, as intermittent airway obstruction caused by airway hyperreactivity to external allergens can cause the symptoms described, including breathlessness, wheezing, and improvement indoors. The other options do not fully explain the child's presentation."
330,"Question: A 29-year-old woman presents to the clinic with complaints of fatigue and palpitations for the past 3 days. She finds it challenging to even stand up and walk around, and was forced to take a sick day from work as a kindergarten teacher. She reports symmetric joint pain in her hands, wrists, knees, and ankles, which worsens in the morning and resolves by evening. Additionally, she has a runny nose and congestion. Medical history is unremarkable. On examination, splenomegaly, pallor, and generalized weakness are observed, with no lymphadenopathy. What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient's symptoms?

A. Anemia of chronic disease
B. Infection with Ebstein-Barr virus
C. Mutation of ankyrin
D. Rheumatoid arthritis

Answer: C. Mutation of ankyrin.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, palpitations, and symmetric joint pain are consistent with a mutation of ankyrin, a gene that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of red blood cells. The splenomegaly and pallor observed on examination also support this diagnosis. Anemia of chronic disease and infection with Ebstein-Barr virus are less likely causes for the patient's symptoms, as there is no evidence of these conditions in her medical history or physical examination findings. Rheumatoid arthritis is also an unlikely diagnosis, given the patient's young age and the absence of other symptoms such as joint swelling or deformity."
331,"Question: A 69-year-old woman presents to her physician's office with cough, increasing fatigue, and reports an alarming loss of 15 kg (33 lb) weight over the last 4 months. She also observes blood-tinged sputum twice over the last week. Which type of cancer is most likely associated with the patient's symptoms?

Options:
A. Mesothelioma - This type of cancer is not likely associated with the patient's symptoms, as it is a rare cancer that affects the lining of the lungs, abdomen, or heart, and is not characterized by a coin-shaped lesion in the periphery of the middle lobe of the right lung.
B. Large cell carcinoma - This type of cancer is also not likely, as it is a rare cancer that accounts for less than 5% of all lung cancers and is characterized by a more central location in the lung.
C. Squamous cell carcinoma - This type of cancer is possible, but the coin-shaped lesion in the periphery of the middle lobe of the right lung is not a typical feature of this type of cancer.
D. Adenocarcinoma - This is the most likely type of cancer associated with the patient's symptoms, as it is the most common type of lung cancer and accounts for approximately 40% of all lung cancers. The coin-shaped lesion in the periphery of the middle lobe of the right lung is a common feature of adenocarcinoma."
332,"Question: A 72-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe, acute right leg pain that started suddenly while doing household chores. He has no history of leg pain at rest or with exertion, and he recently returned from a 6-hour bus ride. His vital signs are: temperature 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse 105/min and irregular, blood pressure 146/92 mm Hg, and right lower extremity is cool and tender to touch. The right lower extremity has decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch, and muscle strength is decreased. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the underlying source of this patient's condition?

A. Echocardiography: Echocardiography is not the most likely option to confirm the underlying source of this patient's condition. Echocardiography is a diagnostic test used to evaluate the structure and function of the heart, and it may not provide information about the source of the patient's leg pain.

B. Doppler ultrasonography of the legs: Doppler ultrasonography of the legs is a diagnostic test used to evaluate blood flow in the legs. It may help identify any blockages or abnormalities in the blood vessels that could be causing the patient's leg pain.

C. Biopsy of a superficial vein: A biopsy of a superficial vein is a diagnostic procedure used to collect a tissue sample from a vein for examination under a microscope. It may help identify any inflammation or abnormalities in the vein that could be causing the patient's leg pain.

D. Digital subtraction angiography: Digital subtraction angiography is a diagnostic test used to evaluate the blood vessels and identify any blockages or abnormalities. It may be useful in determining the source of the patient's leg pain, but it is not the most likely option for this patient's condition based on the symptoms and physical examination findings.

Answer: B. Doppler ultrasonography of the legs."
333,"Question: A 27-year-old man presents to his primary care physician after a recent illness, experiencing constant vomiting and diarrhea with a high fever for the past 48 hours. He is feeling better today and wants to be seen to ensure he is healthy. The patient has a past medical history of schizophrenia well controlled with risperidone and lithium. He takes ibuprofen for knee pain and attempts to stay well hydrated. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 123 mEq/L
Cl-: 90 mEq/L
K+: 3.8 mEq/L
HCO3-: 29 mEq/L
BUN: 42 mg/dL
Glucose: 109 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's laboratory derangements?

A. Aldosterone-secreting mass: This is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's laboratory derangements. While an aldosterone-secreting mass can cause hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, the patient's serum potassium level is normal, and there is no evidence of hyperaldosteronism.

B. Intrarenal injury: This is also unlikely to be the cause of the patient's laboratory derangements. The patient's serum creatinine level is normal, and there is no evidence of acute kidney injury.

C. Psychogenic polydipsia: This is a possibility, as the patient has a history of schizophrenia and may have been experiencing psychotic symptoms that led to excessive fluid intake. However, the patient's history of controlled schizophrenia and the absence of other psychotic symptoms make this explanation less likely.

D. Volume depletion: This is the most likely explanation for the patient's laboratory derangements. The patient's hyponatremia and hyperkalemia are consistent with volume depletion, which can occur due to vomiting and diarrhea leading to fluid and electrolyte loss. The patient's history of knee pain and attempts to stay well hydrated also support this explanation.

Answer: D. Volume depletion"
334,"Question: A 26-year-old man presents to the emergency department with burning during urination and purulent urethral discharge for the past 3 days. He is sexually active with multiple female partners. Previously, he was diagnosed with urethritis caused by gram-negative diplococci and treated with antibiotics, which resolved his symptoms. A Gram stain of his current urethral discharge shows gram-negative intracellular diplococci. Which property of the infecting organism most contributed to the recurrence of this patient's infection?

Options:

A. Expression of beta-lactamase genes
B. Absence of immunogenic proteins
C. Production of enzymes that hydrolyze urea
D. Variation of expressed pilus proteins

Answer: D. Variation of expressed pilus proteins.

The variation of pilus proteins on the surface of the infecting organism allows it to evade the host's immune system and adhere to the urinary tract epithelium more effectively, leading to recurrent infections."
335,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 72-year-old man visits the clinic with a growing lesion on his nose that has been present for two months. He reports no pain, itching, or trauma, but the size of the lesion is causing discomfort. On examination, the nodule is pink with rolled borders, and telangiectasias are visible within the lesion with a central ulceration. What is the characteristic histological appearance of this lesion?

Options:
A. The lesion shows a distinctive pattern of palisading nuclei, indicating a malignant melanocytic lesion.
B. A sawtooth lymphocytic infiltrate is present, suggesting a chronic inflammatory process.
C. Atypical melanocytes are visible, indicating a possible melanocytic nevi.
D. The epidermis shows excessive proliferation with darkening of the skin, consistent with a benign melasma.

Answer: A. Palisading nuclei"
336,"Question: A 36-year-old primigravid woman at 8 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department with vaginal bleeding and mild suprapubic pain. What is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A. Reassurance and follow-up ultrasonography - The bleeding has subsided, and the patient's vital signs are normal. Given the patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption, it is important to monitor her for any potential complications. A follow-up ultrasonography will help to assess the pregnancy and rule out any potential issues.

B. Low-dose aspirin therapy - Aspirin therapy can help to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications, such as placental abruption and preterm labor. However, it is important to note that aspirin therapy should only be initiated after 12 weeks of gestation to minimize the risk of fetal harm. In this case, it is too early to initiate aspirin therapy.

C. Progestin therapy - Progestin therapy can help to reduce the risk of preterm labor and cervical insufficiency. However, it is important to note that progestin therapy should only be initiated after 12 weeks of gestation to minimize the risk of fetal harm. In this case, it is too early to initiate progestin therapy.

D. Complete bed rest - Complete bed rest is not a recommended management option for vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy. In fact, bed rest can increase the risk of venous thromboembolism and other complications. The patient should be encouraged to ambulate and engage in light activities to promote blood flow and reduce the risk of complications.

Answer: A. Reassurance and follow-up ultrasonography."
337,"Question: A 33-year-old man presents with right scrotal swelling and lower abdominal discomfort for the past 2 weeks, along with a firm nontender nodule on the right testicle. Examination reveals gynecomastia, but no inguinal lymphadenopathy. Serum alpha-fetoprotein, LDH, and hCG levels are markedly elevated, and an x-ray and ultrasound of the testis show a cystic 3-cm mass with variable echogenicity. A CT scan of the abdomen reveals multiple hypoattenuating lesions on the liver and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Radiation therapy
B. Cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin therapy
C. Leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin therapy
D. Stem cell transplant

Answer: B. Cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin therapy

Rationale: Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is testicular cancer. Cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin therapy is the most appropriate next step in management, as it is the standard treatment for metastatic testicular cancer. Radiation therapy may be considered as an alternative, but it is not the most appropriate choice based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin therapy is not typically used to treat testicular cancer, and stem cell transplant is not a recommended treatment for this condition."
338,"Question: A 76-year-old woman presents to the physician for a follow-up examination after a previous hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL. She complains of mild dyspnea with exercise and has a normal examination and laboratory results, including:

Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show a monoclonal protein of 20 g/L (non-IgM). Marrow plasmacytosis is 5%.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Annual follow-up with laboratory tests
B. Check beta-2 microglobulin
C. Referral for radiation therapy
D. No further steps are required at this time

Answer: A. Annual follow-up with laboratory tests

Rationale: Given the patient's age and the presence of mild dyspnea with exercise, it is important to monitor her hemoglobin levels and other laboratory values regularly to assess for any changes or progression of her condition. Annual follow-up with laboratory tests is the most appropriate next step in management to ensure that any potential issues are identified and addressed in a timely manner."
339,"Question: A 7-year-old girl presents to the physician with painless bleeding from the vagina 6 hours ago. She has no history of serious illness or trauma. Her height and weight are at the 80th and 95th percentiles, respectively, and her BMI is also elevated. Examination reveals greasy facial skin and sparse axillary hair, with breast development at Tanner stage 3 and pubic hair development at Tanner stage 2. The external genitalia appear normal. Serum glucose is 189 mg/dL, and intravenous administration of leuprolide causes an increase in serum luteinizing hormone. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?

A. Overproduction of adrenal cortisol
B. Compensatory hyperinsulinemia
C. Pulsatile GnRH release
D. Deficiency of thyroid hormones

Answer: C. Pulsatile GnRH release

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with central precocious puberty (CPP), which is caused by excessive pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This condition typically occurs in children who are tall and heavy for their age, and it can be triggered by various factors, including genetic predisposition, brain injury, or tumors. The patient's height and weight, as well as her Tanner stage breast and pubic hair development, are all consistent with CPP. The increase in serum luteinizing hormone after administration of leuprolide also supports this diagnosis, as it is a common finding in CPP. Overproduction of adrenal cortisol, compensatory hyperinsulinemia, and deficiency of thyroid hormones are less likely causes of these findings."
340,"Question: A 5-year-old child is brought to a pediatric clinic by his mother for a rash that started a few days ago. The mother adds that her son has also had a fever and sore throat since last week. His immunizations are up to date. On examination, a rash is present over the trunk and upper extremities and feels like sandpaper to touch. An oropharyngeal examination is suggestive of exudative pharyngitis with a white coat over the tongue. The physician swabs the throat and uses the swab in a rapid antigen detection test kit. He also sends the sample for microbiological culture. The physician then recommends empiric antibiotic therapy and tells the mother that if the boy is left untreated, the likelihood of developing a complication later in life is very high. Which of the following best explains the mechanism underlying the development of the complication the physician is talking about?

A. Antigenic shift: This option is incorrect because the complication the physician is referring to is not caused by a change in the bacteria's antigenic properties.

B. Bacterial tissue invasion: This option is also incorrect because the complication is not caused by the bacteria invading the body's tissues.

C. Molecular mimicry: This is the correct answer. Molecular mimicry is a process in which the bacteria produce proteins that are similar in structure to the body's own proteins, leading to an immune response against the body's own tissues. This can lead to the development of a complication later in life, such as an autoimmune disorder.

D. Toxin-mediated cellular damage: This option is not relevant to the question.

Answer: C. Molecular mimicry"
341,"Question: Please refer to the summary above to answer this question
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Neurogenic bladder
B. Prostate cancer
C. Urethral stricture
D. Benign prostatic hyperplasia

Answer: D. Benign prostatic hyperplasia

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms of frequent urination, urgency, and weak urinary stream are consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland that can cause urinary symptoms, including frequency, urgency, and hesitancy. The patient's history of two episodes of cystitis in the past 4 months and the presence of a slightly enlarged, smooth, non-tender prostate on examination also support this diagnosis. While neurogenic bladder and urethral stricture are possible causes of the patient's symptoms, the likelihood of these conditions is lower based on the patient's medical history and physical examination findings. Prostate cancer is also a possibility, but the patient's age and lack of any other risk factors for prostate cancer make it less likely."
342,"Question: An otherwise healthy 39-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider with a 4-month history of right-leg swelling that has gradually worsened and interferes with daily activities. She denies smoking or alcohol use and has no family history of relevant medical conditions. What is the most likely cause of her condition?

Options:
A. Persistent elevation of venous pressures - This option is unlikely, as the patient's swelling is non-pitting and the overlying skin is rough, thick, and indurated, which suggests lymphedema.
B. Lymphatic hypoplasia - This option is also unlikely, as the patient does not have a history of congenital or acquired lymphatic deficiency.
C. Obstruction of lymphatic channels - This is the most likely cause of the patient's condition. Lymphatic channels can become obstructed due to various reasons, including infection, inflammation, or tumors, leading to lymphedema.
D. Venous thromboembolism - This option is unrelated to the patient's symptoms and is unlikely to cause non-pitting edema of the entire right leg.

Answer: C. Obstruction of lymphatic channels."
343,"Question: The medical student on the pediatric cardiology team is examining a 9-year-old girl who was referred by her primary care physician for unexplained hypertension. She is accompanied by her mother who reveals that the child is generally well but has been significantly less active than her peers for the past year. On exam, the medical student notes a thin girl in no apparent distress appearing slightly younger than stated age. Vital signs reveal a BP is 160/80, HR 80, RR 16. Physical exam is notable only for a clicking sound is noted around the time of systole but otherwise the cardiac exam is normal. Pedal pulses could not be palpated. Which of the following physical exam findings was most likely missed by both the medical student and primary care physician?

Options:

A. Cleft palate - The medical student and primary care physician may have missed identifying a cleft palate, which can be difficult to diagnose during a routine physical exam.
B. Prominent occiput - The medical student and primary care physician may have overlooked the prominent occiput, or back of the skull, which can be a sign of a congenital heart defect.
C. Long philtrum - The medical student and primary care physician may have failed to notice the long philtrum, or nose bridge, which can be a sign of Klinefelter syndrome, a genetic disorder that can cause hypertension.
D. Webbed neck - The medical student and primary care physician are likely to have missed the characteristic sign of webbed neck, or hemithorax, which is a common sign of a congenital heart defect.

Answer: D. Webbed neck."
344,"Question: A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency room with facial weakness. He first noticed difficulty smiling normally while at dinner with friends the night before, and woke up the next day with a complete inability to move the right side of his face. He recently returned from an extended camping trip in the Appalachian Mountains but did not find any tick bites. His medical history includes Achilles tendonitis and carpal tunnel syndrome. He works as a computer programmer and smokes marijuana occasionally but does not smoke cigarettes. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, he is well-appearing but has loss of facial wrinkles along the forehead, eyelids, and nasolabial folds. He is unable to completely close his right eye, raise his eyebrows, or smile with the right side of his mouth. Sensation is intact to light touch along the forehead, maxilla, and mandible bilaterally. Where is the most likely source of this patient's lesion?

A. Inferior orbital fissure: The inferior orbital fissure is a bony structure in the skull that houses the inferior division of the facial nerve. The facial nerve is the most likely source of the patient's symptoms, as loss of facial wrinkles and inability to move the right side of the face are consistent with facial nerve damage.

B. Petrotympanic fissure: The petrotympanic fissure is a bony structure in the skull that houses the internal carotid artery and the facial nerve. While the facial nerve could also be the source of the patient's symptoms, the petrotympanic fissure is less likely given the patient's age and medical history.

C. Superior orbital fissure: The superior orbital fissure is a bony structure in the skull that houses the superior division of the facial nerve. While the superior orbital fissure could be the source of the patient's symptoms, the patient's age and medical history suggest that the inferior orbital fissure is more likely.

D. Stylomastoid foramen: The stylomastoid foramen is a bony opening in the skull that houses the facial nerve. While the stylomastoid foramen could be the source of the patient's symptoms, the patient's age and medical history suggest that the inferior orbital fissure is more likely."
345,"Question:

A 19-year-old woman presents to the primary care clinic to establish care. She has no acute complaints or concerns. Upon further questioning, she shares that she gets frequent nosebleeds and often bleeds from her gums a little after brushing her teeth. She also typically has relatively heavy menstrual periods, soaking eight tampons per day. She has not had any serious bleeding events, and she has never had a blood transfusion. Physical exam is unremarkable. A complete blood count shows mild anemia with a normal platelet count. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?

Options:

A. Perform bone marrow biopsy - This is not the next best step in the management of this patient as bone marrow biopsy is typically used to evaluate for bone marrow disorders, such as leukemia or bone marrow failure, which are not the likely cause of the patient's anemia and bleeding symptoms.

B. Start corticosteroids - Corticosteroids may be considered to treat severe autoimmune disorders that can cause bleeding, such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), but this is not the most appropriate treatment for the patient's mild anemia and frequent nosebleeds.

C. Start intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) - IVIG may be considered to treat autoimmune disorders that cause bleeding, such as ITP, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for the patient's mild anemia and frequent nosebleeds.

D. Perform platelet aggregation tests - Platelet aggregation tests can help identify any abnormalities in platelet function that may be contributing to the patient's bleeding symptoms. This is the next best step in the management of this patient.

Answer: D. Perform platelet aggregation tests."
346,"Question: A 26-year-old man is rushed to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. He doesn't respond to verbal cues or open his eyes on command. A CT scan of his head reveals a hyperdense fluid collection in the right medial temporal lobe, displacing the uncus and parahippocampal gyrus of the temporal lobe. Which of the following cranial nerves is most likely to be injured as a result of this patient's lesion?

A. Facial
B. Vagus
C. Oculomotor
D. Trigeminal

Answer: C. Oculomotor.

Explanation: The patient's lesion in the right medial temporal lobe is likely to have injured the oculomotor nerve, which is responsible for controlling the movement of the eyes. The oculomotor nerve is located in the temporal lobe, and any damage to this area can result in impaired eye movement and other oculomotor functions. The other options, the facial nerve, vagus nerve, and trigeminal nerve, are not as likely to be directly affected by this type of lesion."
347,"Question: A 39-year-old female presents to her gynecologist complaining of a breast lump. Two weeks ago, while performing a breast self-examination, she noticed a small firm nodule in her left breast. She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. Her family history is notable for a history of breast cancer in her mother and maternal aunt. On physical examination, there is a firm immobile nodular mass in the superolateral quadrant of her left breast. A mammogram of her left breast is shown. Genetic analysis reveals a mutation on chromosome 17. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions?

Options:

A. Serous cystadenocarcinoma: This is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and genetic mutation. Serous cystadenocarcinoma is a type of breast cancer that is associated with a genetic mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, which is the same mutation found in this patient. It typically presents as a firm, immobile mass in the breast and is more common in women with a family history of breast cancer.

B. Granulosa-theca cell tumor: This is a rare type of ovarian tumor that can occur in women with a family history of breast cancer. However, it is not as strongly associated with genetic mutations as serous cystadenocarcinoma, and the patient's symptoms and mammogram findings are more consistent with breast cancer.

C. Uterine leiomyosarcoma: This is a rare type of uterine cancer that can occur in women with a family history of breast cancer. However, it is not as strongly associated with genetic mutations as serous cystadenocarcinoma, and the patient's symptoms and mammogram findings are more consistent with breast cancer.

D. Transitional cell carcinoma: This is a type of kidney cancer that can occur in the urinary tract. It is not associated with genetic mutations and is not a likely diagnosis for this patient based on her symptoms and mammogram findings."
348,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 33-year-old woman visits a walk-in clinic with concerns about small bumps around her eyes that have been growing in size since last year. The bumps are not itchy or painful, and she has not sought medical attention in the past due to lack of insurance coverage. Her vital signs are normal, and her medical history is unremarkable. Which of the following initial blood tests would be most appropriate for this patient at this time?

Options:
A. Fasting blood glucose and lipid profile
B. Fasting lipid profile alone
C. Thyroid stimulating hormone alone
D. Fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, and thyroid stimulating hormone

Answer: B. Fasting lipid profile alone"
349,"Question: A 65-year-old man presents to the physician with progressive abdominal distension and swelling of his legs over the past 4 months, with a history of ulcerative colitis. On physical examination, jaundice is noted, and abdominal examination reveals shifting dullness and dilated veins in the periumbilical region. Which of the following vessels is most likely responsible for the abdominal findings in this patient?

A. Hepatic vein
B. Superior epigastric vein
C. Superior mesenteric vein
D. Superior rectal vein

Answer: B. Superior epigastric vein

Explanation: The superior epigastric vein is a significant vessel that drains blood from the abdominal cavity, including the periumbilical region, into the hepatic veins. The patient's symptoms of abdominal distension and swelling, along with the abdominal examination findings of shifting dullness and dilated veins in the periumbilical region, are consistent with increased blood flow in the superior epigastric vein. The hepatic veins, superior mesenteric vein, and superior rectal vein are less likely to be involved in this patient's presentation."
350,"Question: A 27-year-old man with a past medical history of type I diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. Which of the following is the appropriate endpoint of treatment for this patient?

Options:

A. Clinically asymptomatic - This option is incorrect because the patient is already experiencing altered mental status, which is a symptom of their diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Clinical asymptomatic refers to a lack of symptoms, which is not the case for this patient.

B. Normal anion gap - This option is correct. The anion gap is a measure of the difference between the total electrolytes present in the serum and the total electrolytes expected to be present based on the patient's serum sodium, potassium, and chloride levels. In this patient's case, the anion gap is normal, which suggests that the patient's metabolic acidosis is due to a non-anion gap disorder, such as DKA.

C. Normal glucose - This option is incorrect because the patient's glucose level is elevated, which is a common finding in DKA.

D. Vitals stable - This option is incorrect because the patient's vital signs are not stable, as their temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respirations are all abnormal.

Answer: B. Normal anion gap"

353,"Question: A 24-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a 13-day history of headache and sinus drainage, accompanied by cold-like symptoms that have progressively worsened. She has experienced five similar episodes in the past year, and is concerned about the recurrence. Her laboratory results reveal:

Serum:

* Hemoglobin: 16.2 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 39%
* Leukocyte count: 7,890/mm^3 with normal differential
* Platelet count: 200,000/mm^3
* IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
* IgE: 0 IU/mL (Normal: 0-380 IU/mL)
* IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
* IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Common variable immunodeficiency (B)

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent sinusitis and cold-like symptoms, along with her laboratory results, are consistent with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). CVID is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a deficiency in antibody production, which can lead to recurrent infections, particularly of the respiratory and sinus tracts. The patient's history of five similar episodes in the past year, along with her concern about the recurrence, further supports this diagnosis.

Option A, ataxia-telangiectasia, is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, and immunodeficiency. While the patient's symptoms could be consistent with ataxia-telangiectasia, the absence of other typical features and the presence of a normal IgG level rule out this diagnosis.

Option C, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, and immunodeficiency. While the patient's low platelet count could be consistent with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, the absence of other typical features and the presence of a normal IgG level rule out this diagnosis.

Option D, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by a deficiency in B cells and antibody production. While the patient's low IgG level could be consistent with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, the presence of other typical features such as recurrent infections and a normal IgM level rule out this diagnosis."

Options:

A. Mitral valve regurgitation: The most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, as mitral regurgitation can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations.

B. Tricuspid valve regurgitation: Although less common than mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation can also cause similar symptoms, including fatigue, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations.

C. Aortic valve regurgitation: Aortic valve regurgitation can also cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations, although it is less common than mitral or tricuspid regurgitation.

D. Aortic valve stenosis: Aortic valve stenosis can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations, but it is less likely given the patient's age and medical history.

355,"Question: A 28-year-old woman is brought into the clinic by her husband with concerns that she might be depressed. She delivered a healthy newborn a week and a half ago without any complications. Since then, she has been having trouble sleeping, eating poorly, and has stopped playing with the baby. The patient says she feels like she is drained all the time and feels guilty for not doing more for the baby. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?

Options:
A. Reassurance: This option suggests that the patient's symptoms are likely related to the stress of new motherhood and the lack of sleep, rather than a clinical depression. Reassuring the patient that she is doing a good job and that it is normal to feel overwhelmed after giving birth may help to alleviate her symptoms.

B. Fluoxetine: This option suggests that the patient may be experiencing symptoms of postpartum depression, a common condition that affects new mothers. Fluoxetine, an antidepressant, may be effective in treating these symptoms.

C. Amitriptyline: This option suggests that the patient may be experiencing symptoms of postpartum depression, a common condition that affects new mothers. Amitriptyline, an antidepressant, may be effective in treating these symptoms.

D. No treatment: This option suggests that the patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant treatment, or that the patient is not willing to seek treatment. However, it is important to note that postpartum depression can have serious consequences for the mother and the baby if left untreated.

Answer: A. Reassurance."
356,"Question: A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after his mother found him experiencing muscle spasms and stiffness in his room. His mother stated he scraped his foot on a rusty razor on the bathroom floor 2 days prior. On presentation, his temperature is 102.0°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 108/73 mmHg, pulse is 122/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, he is found to have severe muscle spasms and rigid abdominal muscles. In addition, he has a dirty appearing wound on his right foot. The patient's mother does not recall any further vaccinations since age 12. Finally, he is found to have difficulty opening his mouth so he is intubated. Which of the following treatment(s) should be provided to this patient?

A. Antitoxin
B. Wound debridement and antitoxin
C. Wound debridement and booster vaccine
D. Wound debridement, antitoxin, and booster vaccine

Answer: B. Wound debridement and antitoxin

Rationale:

The patient's symptoms of muscle spasms, stiffness, and difficulty opening his mouth are consistent with a tick-borne illness, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The patient's exposure to a rusty razor on the bathroom floor 2 days prior may have caused a superficial wound, which can increase the risk of infection. Therefore, wound debridement is necessary to remove any infected tissue and prevent further complications. Antitoxin is also necessary to treat the tick-borne illness and prevent further muscle spasms and stiffness.

Option A, antitoxin, is not the best choice as it only provides treatment for the tick-borne illness and does not address the superficial wound. Option C, wound debridement and booster vaccine, is not necessary as the patient's mother does not recall any further vaccinations since age 12. Option D, wound debridement, antitoxin, and booster vaccine, is also not the best choice as it includes both wound debridement and antitoxin, which are the appropriate treatments for the patient's condition."
357,"Question: A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of intermittently experiencing abnormal odor perception, particularly of burnt rubber, despite there being no apparent cause. This symptom has been bothering him for the past 6 months, and he has also experienced occasional nosebleeds during this time. He is a high school teacher and while his work can be stressful around exam season, he copes well. There is no significant family history, and he does not smoke or drink alcohol. Upon physical examination, unilateral nasal obstruction with dried blood in the nasal passage is noted. What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Neuroblastoma

B. Hypnagogic hallucination

C. Schizophrenia

D. Psychomotor epilepsy

Answer: B. Neuroblastoma

The patient's symptoms of intermittent abnormal odor perception and occasional nosebleeds, particularly in the context of a unilateral nasal obstruction with dried blood in the nasal passage, are highly suggestive of neuroblastoma. This is a rare and aggressive cancer that can arise in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, and can present with symptoms such as nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and abnormal odor perception. While other conditions such as hypnagogic hallucination, schizophrenia, and psychomotor epilepsy could potentially explain the patient's symptoms, neuroblastoma is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation. A thorough workup, including imaging studies and biopsy, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate management."
358,"Question: A 72-year-old woman presents to the emergency department 4 hours after the sudden onset of a diffuse, dull, throbbing headache, along with blurred vision, nausea, and one episode of vomiting. She has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is taking hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years and drinks 1–2 glasses of wine per day. Her vital signs are: temperature 36.6 °C (97.9 °F), pulse 90/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 185/110 mm Hg. Fundoscopic examination reveals bilateral blurring of the optic disc margins. Physical and neurologic examinations are unremarkable. Complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. Urinalysis shows 2+ protein but no WBCs or RBCs. Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is:

D. Hypertensive emergency.

The patient's sudden onset of severe headache, blurred vision, and hypertension are consistent with a hypertensive emergency. The patient's history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. While ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage are also possibilities, the patient's age and the duration since symptom onset make these conditions less likely. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a less common condition that can cause headache, blurred vision, and hypertension, but it is not typically associated with a history of hypertension and diabetes."

He takes lisinopril, aspirin, metoprolol, and allopurinol. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history and was previously a heroin addict but has not used in over 20 years. He drinks at least six beers per day. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 155/95 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 18/min. He appears disheveled, inattentive, and smells of alcohol. During his prior visits, he has been well-groomed and attentive. When asked what year it is and who the president is, he confidently replies, ""1999"" and ""Jimmy Carter."" He says his son's name is ""Peter"" when it is actually ""Jake."" This patient likely has a lesion in which of the following brain regions?

A. Anterior pillars of the fornix: The patient's confusion and inattention, as well as his inability to recall recent events, suggest a lesion in the anterior pillars of the fornix. This region is involved in the formation and retrieval of memories, and damage to this area can result in memory impairments.

B. Dorsal hippocampus: The dorsal hippocampus is also involved in memory formation and retrieval, and damage to this area can lead to similar memory impairments as seen in the patient.

C. Parahippocampal gyrus: The parahippocampal gyrus is involved in the formation and retrieval of spatial and episodic memories, and damage to this area can result in similar memory impairments.

D. Posterior pillars of the fornix: While the posterior pillars of the fornix are also involved in memory formation and retrieval, the patient's symptoms do not suggest a lesion in this area.

Answer: A. Anterior pillars of the fornix"
362,"Question: A 37-year-old G1P1001 presents for her 6-week postpartum visit after delivering a male infant by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 41 weeks and 5 days gestation. She notes that five days ago, her right breast began to hurt, and the skin near her nipple turned red. She also states that she has felt feverish and generally achy for 2 days but thought she was just sleep deprived. The patient’s son has been having difficulty latching for the last 2 weeks and has begun receiving formula in addition to breast milk, though the patient wishes to continue breastfeeding. She is generally healthy with no past medical history but has smoked half a pack per day for the last 15 years. Her mother died from breast cancer at the age of 62, and her father has hypertension and coronary artery disease. At this visit, her temperature is 100.6° F (38.1° C), blood pressure is 116/73 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. She appears tired and has a slightly flat affect. Examination reveals a 4x4 cm area of erythema on the lateral aspect near the nipple on the right breast. In the center of this area, there is a fluctuant, tender mass that measures 2x2 cm. The overlying skin is intact. The remainder of her exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

A. Mammogram - While a mammogram can help rule out other causes of breast pain and swelling, such as a cyst or fibrocystic change, it may not be necessary in this case as the patient is only 6 weeks postpartum and the breast changes are relatively small.

B. Incision and drainage - This option is not appropriate as the patient's breast changes are likely due to breastfeeding and do not require surgical intervention.

C. Needle aspiration and oral dicloxacillin - This option is the best next step in management. Needle aspiration can help to drain any accumulated milk or fluid in the breast, which may help to relieve the patient's symptoms. Oral dicloxacillin is an antibiotic that can help to prevent or treat any potential bacterial infection.

D. Cessation of smoking - While quitting smoking may be beneficial for the patient's overall health, it is not directly related to the breast changes she is experiencing.

Answer: C. Needle aspiration and oral dicloxacillin"
363,"Question: A 17-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician by his mother for an initial visit. He recently immigrated from Cambodia. Through an interpreter, the patient reports 6 months of mild exertional dyspnea. He denies chest pain or palpitations. His medical history is unremarkable and he has never had any surgeries. His family history is significant for hypertension and diabetes. His father died of tuberculosis. The patient’s vaccination history is unknown. His temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 113/71 mmHg, and pulse is 82/min. His BMI is 24 kg/m^2. Physical examination shows a well-nourished, cooperative boy without any grossly dysmorphic features. Cardiac auscultation reveals a grade II systolic ejection murmur along the left upper sternal border and a mid-diastolic rumble along the left sternal border. S1 is normal and the splitting of S2 does not change with inspiration. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Atrial septal defect

B. Bicuspid aortic valve

C. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

D. Ventricular septal defect

Answer: A. Atrial septal defect

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of mild exertional dyspnea for 6 months, without any chest pain or palpitations, are consistent with atrial septal defect (ASD). ASD is a congenital heart defect that occurs when there is a hole in the septum between the atria, allowing blood to flow abnormally between the chambers. The patient's age and recent immigration from Cambodia also support this diagnosis.

While bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and ventricular septal defect (VSD) are all possible diagnoses, they are less likely given the patient's symptoms and medical history. BAV is a congenital heart defect that occurs when the aortic valve has only two leaflets instead of the usual three, which can lead to obstruction or regurgitation. HCM is a condition where the heart muscle becomes thickened, leading to reduced heart function and potential complications. VSD is a hole in the wall between the ventricles, which can also lead to abnormal blood flow. However, these conditions are less likely given the patient's age and recent immigration, as they are more commonly seen in older adults or those with a family history of cardiovascular disease."

367,"Question: A 44-year-old man presents for a routine check-up. He has a past medical history of rheumatic fever. The patient is afebrile, and the vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiac examination reveals a late systolic crescendo murmur with a mid-systolic click, best heard over the apex and loudest just before S2. Which of the following physical examination maneuvers would most likely cause an earlier onset of the click/murmur?

Options:

A. Handgrip: Gently squeezing the patient's hand may not cause any significant change in the cardiac murmur as it is primarily a cardiac abnormality.

B. Left lateral decubitus position: Lying on the left side may not have a significant impact on the murmur's onset as it is primarily a cardiac abnormality.

C. Rapid squatting: Suddenly changing the patient's position and forcing them to squat may cause a temporary increase in blood pressure and heart rate, which could potentially bring forward the onset of the murmur.

D. Standing: Standing upright may cause an earlier onset of the murmur due to the increased pressure on the heart and blood vessels, which could bring forward the murmur's onset.

Answer: D. Standing.

Explanation: Standing upright can increase the pressure on the heart and blood vessels, which may bring forward the onset of the murmur. This is because the increased pressure can cause the heart to work harder, leading to an earlier onset of the murmur. Therefore, standing is the most likely option to cause an earlier onset of the click/murmur."
368,"Question: A 59-year-old man presents with a painful, burning red rash on his face and hands that developed after spending time outside in the sun. He has a history of occasional sunburns and is currently undergoing chemotherapy for small cell lung carcinoma. He is taking demeclocycline for malignancy-associated hyponatremia and amoxicillin for sinusitis. He also experiences occasional back pain and takes zolpidem and brandy before bedtime. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. His vital signs are: pulse 72/min, blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals prominent erythema on his forehead, cheeks, and neck, as well as erythematous and papular lesions on the dorsum of his hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?

A. Uroporphyrin accumulation: This is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms, as there is no evidence of urinary tract involvement or excessive porphyrin production.

B. Systemic lupus erythematosus: This is also an unlikely cause, as the patient does not have any other symptoms typical of systemic lupus erythematosus, such as joint pain or fatigue.

C. Use of demeclocycline: The patient's symptoms are likely related to the demeclocycline he is taking for malignancy-associated hyponatremia. Demeclocycline can cause a range of cutaneous side effects, including erythematous and papular lesions, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms.

D. Normal sunburn reaction: While the patient does have a sunburn-like rash, it is unlikely to be a normal sunburn reaction given the patient's history of frequent sun exposure and the presence of erythematous and papular lesions on his hands.

Answer: C. Use of demeclocycline."

She feels unenthusiastic about her hobbies and has lost interest in photography, which she was previously passionate about. She experiences feelings of hopelessness and struggles to focus at work. She denies any suicidal ideation. Her medical history includes bulimia nervosa, which was controlled with cognitive behavioral therapy, and gastroesophageal reflux, which is being treated with esomeprazole. She has a 10-pack-year smoking history but denies any alcohol or recreational drug use. On examination, she is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits. Her BMI is 24 kg/m2. Which of the following aspects of this patient's history is a contraindication to using bupropion as an antidepressant?

A. History of bulimia nervosa: The patient's history of bulimia nervosa is a contraindication to using bupropion as an antidepressant. Bupropion can exacerbate eating disorders, such as bulimia nervosa, and may increase the risk of relapse.

B. Age of 22 years: The patient's age is not a contraindication to using bupropion as an antidepressant. Bupropion can be effective in treating depression in individuals of all ages, including young adults.

C. BMI of 24 kg/m2: The patient's BMI is within the normal range, and it is not a contraindication to using bupropion as an antidepressant. However, obesity may be a comorbidity that can increase the risk of adverse effects from bupropion.

D. Esomeprazole usage: The patient's usage of esomeprazole is not a contraindication to using bupropion as an antidepressant. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux, and it does not interact with bupropion."

378,"Question: A 40-year-old chronic smoker presents to the office with complaints of a cough, pleuritic chest pain, and a 2.2 kg (5 lb) weight loss over the past month. He also reports shoulder pain that has been present for the past 2 weeks. There are no signs of fever or night sweats. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Pancoast tumor
B. Small cell carcinoma of the lung
C. Histiocytosis X
D. Pulmonary tuberculosis

Answer: C. Histiocytosis X

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is Histiocytosis X. The presence of bilateral velcro-like crackles in the upper to middle lung fields, along with the swelling on the right shoulder, are consistent with this diagnosis. Histiocytosis X is a rare disorder characterized by the accumulation of histiocytes in the lungs, which can cause nodular opacities and a lytic lesion on the humeral head. The patient's history of chronic smoking may have contributed to the development of this condition. Pancoast tumor, small cell carcinoma of the lung, and pulmonary tuberculosis are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings."

The nodule has poorly defined margins, and it shows a dense, irregular pattern of calcification. The patient is immediately referred to a pulmonologist for evaluation of the lesion. The patient denies any recent illnesses and states that she has not traveled outside of the country since she was a child. She has had no sick contacts or respiratory symptoms, and she does not currently take any medications. She does, however, admit to a 20-pack-year history of smoking. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluating this patient’s diagnosis with regard to the pulmonary nodule?

Try to obtain previous chest radiographs for comparison (D)

Explanation:

Given the patient's history of smoking and the presence of a pulmonary nodule with poorly defined margins and a dense, irregular pattern of calcification, it is important to evaluate the nodule's malignant potential. Obtaining previous chest radiographs for comparison can help to assess the nodule's size, shape, and any changes over time, which can aid in determining its potential malignancy.

Option A, obtaining a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest, is not the most appropriate next step as it is not necessary to evaluate the nodule's malignant potential at this time. Option B, sending sputum for cytology, is also not relevant as the patient does not have any respiratory symptoms. Option C, performing a flexible bronchoscopy with biopsy, is also not necessary as the patient does not have any respiratory symptoms and the nodule is located in the middle lobe of the right lung, which is not accessible through bronchoscopy."
380,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 30-year-old woman visits her physician due to difficulty sleeping. She finds it challenging to fall asleep and wakes up earlier than expected. Four months ago, she was involved in a tragic car accident that resulted in the loss of her unborn child. Since then, she has been experiencing vivid nightmares related to the event and frequently re-lives the accident. She feels immense guilt and blames herself for the death of her child, which has led to her stopping work as an accountant, avoiding driving, and withdrawing from her loved ones. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Acute stress disorder - This condition is characterized by symptoms of extreme distress, anxiety, and disorganization that last for less than one month after a traumatic event. While the woman's symptoms have persisted for several months, it is possible that they may be related to another condition.

B. Major depressive disorder - Depression is a mood disorder that can cause persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities. While the woman's guilt and withdrawal from loved ones could be indicative of depression, the primary focus of her distress is on the traumatic event, which suggests that another condition may be more relevant.

C. Post-traumatic stress disorder - This condition occurs after a person experiences a traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, physical attack, or, in this case, the loss of her unborn child. Symptoms include intrusive memories, avoidance behaviors, and hyperarousal, which are all present in the woman's case.

D. Adjustment disorder - This condition occurs when a person experiences emotional and behavioral distress in response to a major life change or stressor, such as the loss of a loved one. However, the symptoms of adjustment disorder typically last for less than six months, which may not align with the woman's prolonged experience of distress.

Answer: C. Post-traumatic stress disorder."
381,"Question: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to a 2-day history of fever, headache, and irritability. He shares a room with his 7-year-old brother, who doesn't have any symptoms. The patient appears weak and lethargic. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F) and blood pressure is 99/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows several purple spots over the trunk and extremities. A lumbar puncture is performed, and Gram stain of the cerebrospinal fluid shows numerous gram-negative diplococci. Which of the following is most likely to prevent infection of the patient's brother at this time?

A. Penicillin G
B. Cephalexin
C. Rifampin
D. Doxycycline

Answer: C. Rifampin

Rifampin is the most likely choice to prevent infection of the patient's brother at this time. Rifampin is an antibiotic that is effective against gram-negative bacteria, such as the diplococci found in the patient's cerebrospinal fluid. It is important to start antibiotic treatment as soon as possible to prevent the spread of infection, especially in close contacts such as siblings who share a room. Penicillin G and cephalexin are also effective against gram-positive bacteria, but they may not be as effective against gram-negative bacteria like the ones found in the patient's cerebrospinal fluid. Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but it is not as effective against meningitis caused by gram-negative bacteria as rifampin is."
382,"Question: A 38-year-old woman is evaluated for a difficult-to-control hypertension. Her symptoms include sleep interruption due to frequent waking up for voiding and frequent headaches. She has smoked 10 cigarettes daily for the past 5 years. Family history is insignificant. Her vital signs include a blood pressure of 170/96 mm Hg, pulse of 90/min, and temperature of 36.7°C (98.0°F). Physical examination is unremarkable. Her lab results are shown:

Serum sodium: 146 mEq/L
Serum potassium: 4 mEq/L
Serum bicarbonate: 29 mEq/L
Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC): plasma renin activity (PRA) ratio measured after following all precautions is found to be elevated. Oral salt loading testing reveals a lack of aldosterone suppression. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the adrenal glands shows a 2 cm mass on the left side.

Which of the following is the best next step for this patient?

A. Renal angiogram
B. Adrenal venous sampling
C. Left laparoscopic adrenalectomy
D. Treatment with eplerenone

Answer: B. Adrenal venous sampling

Explanation:

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is primary aldosteronism (PA), a condition in which the adrenal glands produce too much aldosterone. The elevated PAC:PRA ratio and lack of aldosterone suppression on oral salt loading testing support this diagnosis. Adrenal venous sampling (AVS) is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of PA and identify the underlying cause of the aldosterone excess. AVS involves collecting blood samples from the adrenal vein, which can help differentiate between aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA) and glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA). The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that she may have an APA, and AVS can help confirm this diagnosis and guide further management.

Renal angiogram (option A) is not necessary for the diagnosis and management of primary aldosteronism. Adrenal venous sampling (option C) is a more invasive procedure that involves collecting tissue samples from the adrenal glands, which may be necessary in some cases of primary aldosteronism, but it is not the first-line diagnostic test. Treatment with eplerenone (option D) is a medication that is used to treat hypertension and aldosterone-producing adenomas, but it is not a diagnostic test."
383,"Question: A 35-year-old woman presents with progressive left flank pain and increased urinary frequency over the past two weeks. She has a history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus and inconsistent use of condoms with her sexually active boyfriend. Her temperature is 38° C (100.4° F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant with no guarding or rebound, and tenderness to percussion along the left flank. She experiences pain when her left hip is passively extended. Urinalysis shows 3+ glucose, and an ultrasound of the abdomen is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Ectopic pregnancy
B. Nephrolithiasis
C. Psoas muscle abscess
D. Uterine leiomyoma

Answer: C. Psoas muscle abscess

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of progressive left flank pain and increased urinary frequency, along with the tenderness to palpation and percussion in the left lower quadrant, are consistent with a psoas muscle abscess. The patient's history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus and inconsistent use of condoms also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. Ectopic pregnancy, nephrolithiasis, and uterine leiomyoma are less likely given the patient's symptoms and medical history."
384,"Question:

A 38-year-old woman presents to the physician with a 4-month history of persistent abdominal cramping, recurrent watery diarrhea, and a 2.5-kg (5.5-lb) weight loss. Her husband has observed that after meals, her face and neck become red, and she experiences shortness of breath and wheezing. Physical examination reveals a grade 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. The abdomen is soft and tender to palpation with minimal guarding or rebound. Without treatment, this patient is at highest risk of developing which of the following conditions?

Options:

A. Laryngeal edema
B. Pigmented dermatitis
C. Megaloblastic anemia
D. T-cell lymphoma

Answer: B. Pigmented dermatitis"
385,"Question: A 63-year-old man with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is brought to the emergency department 1 hour after his daughter found him unresponsive. Despite appropriate care, the patient dies. At autopsy, examination of the lungs shows enlargement of the airspaces in the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli. Destruction of which of the following cells is the most likely cause of these findings?

Options:
A. Non-ciliated cuboidal cells
B. Type I pneumocytes
C. Type II pneumocytes
D. Ciliated columnar cells

Answer: B. Type I pneumocytes

Explanation:
The enlargement of the airspaces in the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli in the lungs of the patient with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency suggests that there has been damage to the Type I pneumocytes, also known as alveolar type II cells. These cells are responsible for producing surfactant, a critical component of lung function that helps to maintain the structure of the alveoli and prevent collapse during exhalation. Destruction of these cells can lead to a deficiency in surfactant production, which can result in respiratory failure and death. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause of the findings observed at autopsy."
386,"Question: A 45-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of night sweats, cough, and fever. What is the most likely lung infection causing his symptoms?

Options:
A. Mycobacterium avium complex: This bacterium can cause lung infections in people with compromised immune systems, but it is not typically associated with night sweats and fever.
B. Cytomegalovirus: This virus can cause pneumonia and other respiratory infections, but it is not typically associated with a history of non-compliance with HAART therapy.
C. M. tuberculosis: Tuberculosis is a common cause of lung infections, particularly in people with a history of HIV infection. The patient's history of non-compliance with HAART therapy and the presence of a cavity in the right upper lobe of his lung suggest a possible TB infection.
D. Histoplasmosis: This fungal infection can cause lung infections, but it is typically associated with exposure to soil or dust contaminated with histoplasma spores.

Answer: C. M. tuberculosis."

389,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 51-year-old Indian man visits his physician with blisters on both hands that have been present for two months. He works outdoors on freeways and highways, repaving cracked or damaged roads. He recently experienced a sharp pain in his thighs and lower back, which he attributed to carrying heavy loads of cement. He has been self-medicating with over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. The patient's skin appears healthy, but there are hyperpigmented scars and bullae on the dorsal surface of both hands. What is the next step in this patient's management?

Options:
A. Consider removing gluten from the patient's diet (unrelated to the patient's condition)
B. Perform a stool guaiac test (unrelated to the patient's condition)
C. Check the patient's urine uroporphyrin level (the most likely cause of the blisters)
D. Check the patient's antinuclear antibody levels and renal panel (unrelated to the patient's condition)

Answer: C. Check the patient's urine uroporphyrin level. The patient's blisters are likely caused by occupational exposure to chemicals, which can lead to a condition called porphyria. A urine uroporphyrin level test can confirm the diagnosis and guide further management."
390,"Question: A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with complaints of fatigue, mild headache, and difficulty chewing for approximately one week. Prior to this, he was feeling well, but these symptoms have significantly impacted his quality of life. His medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both of which are well-controlled. On examination, he appears uncomfortable but nontoxic, with mild tenderness to palpation over his right temporal artery. Given his symptoms and medical history, prompt recognition and treatment can prevent which of the following feared complications:

A. Renal failure
B. Blindness
C. Pulmonary fibrosis
D. Cognitive impairment

Answer: B. Blindness

The correct answer is Blindness. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, mild headache, and difficulty chewing could be indicative of temporal arteritis, a condition that can lead to blindness if left untreated. Temporal arteritis is an inflammation of the blood vessels in the temples, typically caused by an autoimmune response. If prompt treatment is not provided, it can result in permanent vision loss. Therefore, it is crucial to consider temporal arteritis in the differential diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment to prevent blindness."

C. Hypoglycemia (Low blood sugar levels)
D. Hypernatremia (High levels of sodium in the blood)

Answer: A. Hyperuricemia"
392,"Question: A 8-month-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of shortening of his arms and legs, as well as progressive enlargement of his head. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:
A. Growth hormone therapy - This option is not the most appropriate next step in management, as the patient's symptoms suggest a different underlying condition. Growth hormone therapy is typically used to treat growth hormone deficiency, and it is not likely to address the patient's macrocephaly and shortening of the extremities.

B. Levothyroxine therapy - Thyroid hormone replacement therapy may be considered for patients with hypothyroidism, but it is not relevant to the patient's presentation in this case.

C. CT scan of the head - A CT scan of the head can help to further evaluate the patient's macrocephaly and identify any underlying structural abnormalities in the brain. This is the most appropriate next step in management.

D. Bisphosphonate therapy - Bisphosphonate therapy is used to treat bone disorders, but it is not relevant to the patient's presentation in this case.

Answer: C. CT scan of the head."
393,"Question: A 31-year-old male presents to the emergency room following an altercation with patrons at a local grocery store. He is acting aggressively toward hospital staff and appears to be speaking to non-existent individuals. On examination he is tachycardic and diaphoretic. Horizontal and vertical nystagmus is noted. The patient eventually admits to taking an illegal substance earlier in the evening. Which of the following mechanisms of action is most consistent with the substance this patient took?

Options:

A. Adenosine antagonist: This option is incorrect because the patient's tachycardia and diaphoresis do not suggest an adenosine antagonist effect. Adenosine antagonists typically cause bradycardia and hypotension.

B. Mu receptor agonist: This option is also incorrect because the patient's aggressive behavior and hallucinations do not suggest a mu receptor agonist effect. Mu receptor agonists typically produce feelings of euphoria and relaxation.

C. GABA agonist: This option is unlikely because the patient's tachycardia and diaphoresis do not suggest a GABA agonist effect. GABA agonists typically produce sedation and hypotonia.

D. NMDA receptor antagonist: This option is the most likely mechanism of action for the substance the patient took. NMDA receptor antagonists can cause aggressive behavior, hallucinations, and altered sensorium, all of which are consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Answer: D. NMDA receptor antagonist."
394,"Question: A 28-year-old man presents to the physician with skin lesions on and around his anus. He noticed them 3 days ago and they are not painful. He has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years and drinking 6-7 beers on weekends. He is sexually active with two male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He appears healthy. A photograph of the perianal region is shown. The lesions turn white after application of a dilute acetic acid solution. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV test is negative. What is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A. Oral acyclovir - This is not the most appropriate next step in management as acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections, not skin lesions caused by bacterial infections.

B. Topical mometasone - Topical corticosteroids such as mometasone can be used to reduce inflammation and itching associated with skin infections, but they are not effective against bacterial infections.

C. Parenteral benzathine penicillin - Penicillin is an effective antibiotic against bacterial infections, but it is not the most appropriate choice for treating skin lesions in this location.

D. Curettage - Curettage is a surgical procedure that involves scraping away the infected skin with a curette, followed by application of an antibiotic ointment. This is the most appropriate next step in management as it can help to remove the infected skin and promote healing.

Answer: D. Curettage"
395,"Question: A 32-year-old woman presents to the physician with a 4-day history of low-grade fever, joint pain, and muscle aches. She was severely sunburned on her face and arms the day before the onset of her symptoms and has been feeling unusually fatigued over the past 3 months. Her temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F). Examination reveals bilateral swelling and tenderness in the wrists and metacarpophalangeal joints, as well as multiple nontender superficial ulcers on the oral mucosa. Which of the following is most specific for this patient's condition?

A. Cell nucleus
B. Single-stranded DNA
C. Fc region of IgG
D. Nuclear Sm proteins

Answer: D. Nuclear Sm proteins

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of joint pain, muscle aches, and oral ulcers, along with her recent sunburn, are consistent with the diagnosis of sunburned skin syndrome, also known as solar urticaria. The detection of antibodies directed against nuclear Sm proteins is most specific for this condition, as it is a type of autoimmune disorder that occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own skin cells. The other options (cell nucleus, single-stranded DNA, and Fc region of IgG) are not as specific for this condition."
396,"Question: A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents for difficulty breathing. He was playing outside in the snow and had a sudden onset of wheezing and gasping. His medical history includes eczema and nut allergies. The patient's breathing rate is 22/min and he is leaning forward with his hands on his legs as he sits on the table. Physical examination reveals inspiratory and expiratory wheezes. A nebulized medication is administered and begins to relieve the patient's breathing difficulties. Which of the following is increased in this patient as a result of this medication?

A. Cyclic GMP
B. Cyclic AMP
C. Protein kinase C
D. ATP

Answer: B. Cyclic AMP

Explanation:
The nebulized medication administered to the patient is likely a bronchodilator, which works by increasing the concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in the airways. cAMP is a messenger molecule that stimulates the relaxation of airway smooth muscle, leading to increased airflow and relieving breathing difficulties. As a result of the medication, the concentration of cAMP in the patient's airways is increased, leading to improved breathing."
397,"Question: A 3-year-old boy presents to the office with his mother, concerned about his weakness and difficulty walking. The mother reports that her son recently learned to walk after a significant delay and has difficulty with gross and fine motor skills. The boy's vital signs are within normal range, and upon physical examination, he appears well-developed and pleasant. A genetic study reveals a significant deletion in the gene that codes for dystrophin. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Duchenne muscular dystrophy - This is the most likely diagnosis based on the boy's symptoms and the genetic study results. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a severe form of muscular dystrophy caused by a deletion or mutation of the dystrophin gene. It typically presents with delayed walking and muscle weakness, especially in the legs and pelvis, which worsens over time.

B. Becker muscular dystrophy - Becker muscular dystrophy is another form of muscular dystrophy caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene. It is less severe than Duchenne muscular dystrophy and typically presents with a later age of onset and slower progression of symptoms. However, Becker muscular dystrophy can also cause difficulty with walking and muscle weakness, which may be evident at the age of 3.

C. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy - Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the muscles of the arms and legs. It can cause weakness and wasting of the muscles, particularly in the shoulders and hips, but may not necessarily affect the ability to walk. However, the symptoms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy can vary widely between different subtypes, and the diagnosis should be considered based on the boy's specific symptoms and medical history.

D. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy - Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a rare genetic disorder that affects the muscles of the upper and lower limbs, as well as the heart and nervous system. It typically presents with delayed walking and muscle weakness, as well as cardiac and respiratory problems. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is less likely to be the diagnosis in this case based on the boy's age and symptoms."
398,"Question: A 60-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband due to worsening shortness of breath over the past 2 days. Last week, she had a sore throat and low-grade fever. She has coughed up white sputum each morning for the past 2 years. She has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 35 years. Current medications include metformin and lisinopril. On examination, she occasionally has to catch her breath between sentences. Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 140/70 mm Hg. Expiratory wheezes with a prolonged expiratory phase are heard over both lung fields. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows:
pH 7.33
PCO2 53 mm Hg
PO2 68 mm Hg
An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation of bilateral lung fields and flattening of the diaphragm. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?

B. Decreased urinary bicarbonate excretion

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of worsening shortness of breath and chest wheezing, along with her history of smoking and chronic lung disease, suggest the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The arterial blood gas analysis shows a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and an increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), which is consistent with COPD. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of hyperinflation on the chest x-ray further support this diagnosis.

Decreased urinary bicarbonate excretion is a common finding in COPD patients, particularly those with more advanced disease. This is due to the acidic environment in the lungs, which can lead to a decrease in bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubules of the kidneys.

Therefore, option B is the most likely additional finding in this patient."
399,"Question: A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician due to a lesion on his jaw that has been growing for several months. He recently immigrated to the USA from Kenya with his family. Physical examination reveals a 3-cm solid mass above the left mandible, along with cervical lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the mass shows sheets of lymphocytes and interspersed reactive histiocytes with abundant, clear cytoplasm and phagocytosed debris. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely directly responsible for the malignant transformation of this patient's cells?

A. Activation of transcription: The lesion in this patient's jaw is likely caused by the activation of transcription factors, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and division. This is a common mechanism of malignant transformation in cancer.

B. Defect in DNA repair: The presence of phagocytosed debris in the biopsy sample suggests that the patient's cells may have difficulty repairing DNA damage, which can lead to mutations and malignant transformation.

C. Impairment of receptor function: The interspersed reactive histiocytes in the biopsy sample may indicate that the patient's cells are unable to properly respond to growth factors or other signals, leading to uncontrolled cell growth.

D. Inhibition of cell cycle arrest: The patient's cells may be unable to properly arrest their cell cycle, leading to uncontrolled growth and division. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic mutations or disruptions to normal cellular signaling pathways."
400,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 56-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of left lower abdominal pain, fever, and constipation. He has a history of prior cholecystectomy and smokes a pack of cigarettes daily. His vital signs are within normal limits, but abdominal examination reveals left lower quadrant tenderness without guarding or rebound. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast shows segmental wall thickening of the descending colon with multiple diverticula, surrounding fat stranding, and a 5.5-cm, low-attenuating pelvic fluid collection. The patient is started on intravenous fluids, bowel rest, and antibiotics. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient?

A) Observe the patient and perform serial CT scans to monitor for any changes.
B) Perform a left laparoscopic hemicolectomy to remove the affected segment of colon.
C) Use CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage to drain the collection and reduce the infection.
D) Perform a segmental colonic resection to remove the affected segment of colon.

Answer: C) CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage.

Rationale: The CT scan findings suggest the presence of an abscess in the pelvic region, which can be effectively managed through CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage. This approach allows for the drainage of the abscess without the need for open surgery, which can be beneficial in patients with a history of previous abdominal surgery. Additionally, antibiotics and bowel rest are already being administered, which can help to manage the infection and promote healing. Observing the patient and performing serial CT scans may not provide a definitive diagnosis or treatment plan, and left laparoscopic hemicolectomy or segmental colonic resection are more invasive procedures that may not be necessary at this time."
401,"Question: A healthy 48-year-old male presents for a well-patient visit. He has no symptoms and feels well. Past medical history includes asthma, chronic sinusitis, and nasal polyps. He occasionally takes diphenhydramine for allergies. Both of his parents and an elder brother are in good health. Today, his blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, heart rate is 101/min, respiratory rate is 21/min, and temperature is 37°C (98.6°F). Routine screening blood work reveals elevated total cholesterol. The patient asks if he should take low-dose aspirin to reduce his risk of stroke and heart attack. Of the following options, choose the best response:

D. Have you had a reaction to aspirin in the past?

Explanation:
The patient's history of asthma, chronic sinusitis, and nasal polyps may increase their risk of aspirin-related complications, such as bronchospasm or nasal bleeding. Therefore, it is important to assess the patient's previous reaction to aspirin before initiating therapy. Option D is the best response to this question."
402,"Question: A 56-year-old woman presents to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She exercises every day and follows a healthy diet. She does not smoke and consumes alcohol moderately. There is no family history of chronic disease. Her blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg, which is confirmed on a repeat measurement. Her BMI is 23 kg/m2. The physical examination shows no abnormal findings. The laboratory test results show:

Serum Total cholesterol: 193 mg/dL
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C): 124 mg/dL
High-density lipoprotein (HDL-C): 40 mg/dL
Triglycerides: 148 mg/dL
Her 10-year risk of CVD is 3.6%. She is prescribed antihypertensive medication. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?

Options:
A. Atorvastatin
B. Evolocumab
C. Ezetimibe
D. No pharmacotherapy at this time

Answer: A. Atorvastatin

Rationale: The patient's elevated LDL-C level of 124 mg/dL and low HDL-C level of 40 mg/dL indicate a high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Atorvastatin is a statin medication that is effective in reducing LDL-C levels and is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time. Evolocumab is a PCSK9 inhibitor that is also used to lower LDL-C levels, but it is typically reserved for patients with very high LDL-C levels (>190 mg/dL) or those who are not adequately controlled on statin therapy. Ezetimibe is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor that is also used to lower LDL-C levels, but it is less effective than statins and is typically used in combination with statins. Therefore, option D is not the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time."
403,"Question: A 12-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother 2 hours after cutting her hand while playing in the yard. Examination of the right hand shows a 2-cm laceration on the thenar region of the palm with some surrounding tenderness and erythema. The right palm appears mildly swollen in comparison to the left. In response to this patient's injury, the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels of the affected area express increased numbers of cellular adhesion molecules. Which of the following mediators is most likely directly responsible for the described change?

Options:
A. Interleukin-10
B. Interleukin-1
C. Interleukin-6
D. Interferon gamma

Answer: B. Interleukin-1

Explanation:
The passage states that the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels of the affected area express increased numbers of cellular adhesion molecules, which suggests that the injury has triggered an inflammatory response. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a potent inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in the early stages of inflammation. It is produced by a variety of cells, including endothelial cells, in response to tissue damage or infection. Therefore, option B, Interleukin-1, is the most likely mediator responsible for the described change in the patient's condition."

405,"Question: A 24-year-old woman, gravida 1, at 35 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital with regular contractions and pelvic pressure for the last 5 hours. Which of the following pharmacotherapies is the most appropriate at this time?

Options:
A. Magnesium sulfate: This medication is commonly used to treat preterm labor, particularly when there is a risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). It works by stabilizing the membranes and reducing the risk of further contractions.
B. Oxytocin: This medication is often used to stimulate contractions in pregnant women who are experiencing labor. It works by increasing the strength and frequency of contractions, which can help to progress the labor.
C. Terbutaline: This medication is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist that is sometimes used to treat preterm labor. It works by slowing down the contractions and giving the woman more time to consider her options for further management of the preterm labor.
D. No pharmacotherapy at this time: Given the woman's uncomplicated pregnancy and lack of any complications, it may be appropriate to monitor her closely and observe the progression of the labor without any immediate pharmacotherapy.

Answer: D. No pharmacotherapy at this time. While magnesium sulfate and oxytocin are both commonly used to treat preterm labor, the woman's uncomplicated pregnancy and lack of any complications suggest that immediate pharmacotherapy may not be necessary at this time. It is important to closely monitor the woman's condition and adjust the management plan as needed based on her individual circumstances."
406,"Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of recurrent skin lesions. The episodes of lesions started at the age of 3 months. He has also had several episodes of respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers since birth. The boy attends daycare. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 5th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight. He appears ill. Temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Examination shows several raised, erythematous lesions of different sizes over the face, neck, groin, and extremities; some are purulent. Bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy are present. What is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. Defective neutrophil chemotaxis - This option is incorrect because the symptoms described, such as recurrent skin lesions, respiratory tract infections, and lymphadenopathy, are more consistent with an immune-mediated disorder rather than a defect in neutrophil chemotaxis.

B. NADPH oxidase deficiency - This option is the correct answer. NADPH oxidase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are essential for the immune system to function properly. A deficiency in NADPH oxidase can lead to a compromised immune system, resulting in recurrent infections and immune-mediated disorders such as the one described in the case.

C. Impaired repair of double-strand DNA breaks - This option is incorrect because the symptoms described do not suggest a problem with DNA repair.

D. Impaired signaling to actin cytoskeleton reorganization - This option is also incorrect because the symptoms described do not suggest a problem with actin cytoskeleton reorganization.

Answer: B. NADPH oxidase deficiency"
407,"Question: A 57-year-old man presents to the emergency department for feeling weak for the past week. He states that he has felt much more tired than usual and has had a subjective fever during this time. The patient has a past medical history of IV drug use, hepatitis C, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis, alcohol dependence, obesity, and depression. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 157/98 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, you note a fatigued man with diffuse yellowing of his skin. Cardiopulmonary exam is notable for bibasilar crackles on auscultation. Abdominal exam is notable for abdominal distension, dullness to percussion, and a fluid wave. The patient complains of generalized tenderness on palpation of his abdomen. The patient is started on piperacillin-tazobactam and is admitted to the medical floor. On day 4 of his stay in the hospital the patient is afebrile and his pulse is 92/min. His abdominal tenderness is reduced but is still present. Diffuse yellowing of the patient's skin and sclera is still notable. The nurses notice bleeding from the patient's 2 peripheral IV sites that she has to control with pressure. A few new bruises are seen on the patient's arms and legs.

Best explanation for this patient's condition:

A. Bacterial destruction

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fever, fatigue, and abdominal tenderness, along with the diffuse yellowing of his skin and sclera, are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy is a complication of liver disease, such as cirrhosis, where the liver's inability to detoxify ammonia leads to a buildup of toxins in the brain, causing neuropsychiatric symptoms. The patient's history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis, along with his recent use of IV drugs, increase his risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy. The presence of bibasilar crackles on auscultation and abdominal distension, dullness to percussion, and a fluid wave on abdominal exam also support this diagnosis. The patient's afebrile status and reduced abdominal tenderness on day 4 of his hospital stay suggest that his condition is improving with treatment."
408,"Question: A new drug is designed to treat asthma by inhibiting bronchoconstriction. Experimental assays show that treated animals had markedly reduced acetylcholine binding to muscarinic receptors relative to untreated controls. The drug is most similar to which of the following:

A. Cromolyn: This drug is a methylxanthine that inhibits the release of histamine from mast cells, which can contribute to bronchoconstriction in asthma. However, it does not directly affect muscarinic receptors.

B. Zafirlukast: This drug is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that blocks the action of leukotrienes, which are inflammatory mediators that can cause bronchoconstriction in asthma. While it may have some effect on muscarinic receptors, it is not the most direct mechanism of action for inhibiting bronchoconstriction.

C. Prednisone: This is a steroid medication that can help reduce inflammation in the airways, which can contribute to bronchoconstriction in asthma. However, it does not directly affect muscarinic receptors.

D. Ipratropium: This drug is a muscarinic antagonist that directly blocks the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in the airways. By blocking the action of acetylcholine, ipratropium can help relax the airways and improve breathing in individuals with asthma. Therefore, the answer is D. Ipratropium."
409,"Question: A 23-year-old man presents with a 2-year history of gradually increasing lightening of his skin on both hands, under his eyes, and on his neck. There is no itchiness or pain. He has regular visits to his family in India. His vital signs are normal. Examination reveals sharply demarcated, depigmented skin patches on the back of both hands, around the eyes, and on the neck. Skin sensation is intact. The lesions fluoresce blue-white under Wood's lamp. Which of the following findings is most likely to be associated with this patient's diagnosis?

A. ""Spaghetti and meatballs"" appearance on KOH scraping
B. Decreased pigment with normal melanocyte count
C. Elevated anti-TPO antibody levels
D. Renal angiomyolipoma on abdominal MRI

Answer: C. Elevated anti-TPO antibody levels

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with vitiligo, an autoimmune disorder that causes depigmentation of the skin. Elevated anti-TPO antibody levels are commonly seen in patients with vitiligo, as it is an autoimmune disease that involves the immune system attacking the melanocytes, leading to depigmentation. The other options are not as likely to be associated with the patient's diagnosis. ""Spaghetti and meatballs"" appearance on KOH scraping is a characteristic finding of psoriasis, but it is not typically seen in vitiligo. Decreased pigment with normal melanocyte count is a finding that can be seen in various skin conditions, including vitiligo, but it is not specific to this diagnosis. Renal angiomyolipoma on abdominal MRI is a rare benign tumor that can occur in the kidneys, but it is not related to vitiligo."
410,"Question: A 67-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. The patient is non-verbal at baseline, but his caretakers at the nursing home noticed he was particularly somnolent recently. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and Alzheimer dementia. His temperature is 99.7°F (37.6°C), blood pressure is 157/98 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Laboratory values are obtained and shown below.

The patient has lost 20 pounds over the past month. His parathyroid hormone is within normal limits, and his urinary calcium is increased. Physical exam demonstrates discomfort when the patient's lower back and extremities are palpated. Which of the following is the most accurate diagnostic test for this patient's underlying diagnosis?

A. Bone marrow biopsy
B. Radiograph of the lumbar spine
C. Urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures
D. Urine protein levels

Answer: A. Bone marrow biopsy

Explanation: The patient's altered mental status, somnolence, and weight loss suggest a possible diagnosis of hypocalcemia (low calcium levels in the blood). A bone marrow biopsy would be the most accurate diagnostic test to determine if the patient has a parathyroid gland disorder, which is the most common cause of hypocalcemia. A biopsy of the bone marrow would allow for the evaluation of the patient's calcium levels and the presence of any abnormal cells that may indicate a parathyroid gland disorder.

The other options are not as relevant to the patient's diagnosis:

B. Radiograph of the lumbar spine would not provide information on the patient's calcium levels or parathyroid gland function.

C. Urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures would not be useful in diagnosing hypocalcemia, as it is not a bacterial infection.

D. Urine protein levels would not be elevated in this patient, as there is no evidence of proteinuria (excess protein in the urine)."
411,"Question: The 76-year-old female patient with a history of obesity, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and insulin-dependent diabetes presents for her regular checkup. She has been non-adherent to her diabetes treatment regimen, with poor sugar checking and forgetfulness of mealtime insulin administration. Her recent Hemoglobin A1c was 14.1%. As a result of her diabetes, she has developed worsening diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Based on her clinical presentation, which of the following conditions is the patient most at risk for developing?

Options:
A. Stress incontinence - This is not a risk factor for the patient.
B. Overflow incontinence - The patient is most at risk for developing overflow incontinence due to her diabetes-related neuropathy, which can lead to urinary retention and incontinence.
C. Rectal prolapse - This is not a risk factor for the patient.
D. Hemorrhoids - This is not a risk factor for the patient.

Answer: B. Overflow incontinence."
412,"Question: A 67-year-old woman is brought to the clinic by her husband for changes in personality. He reports that 3 years ago she began to forget day-to-day things (e.g., where her keys are and the directions home). She would intermittently forget who her friends are and put the remote in the refrigerator. Recently, the husband noticed stark changes in her personality as she is more impatient, aggressive, and sometimes violent. She denies any fever, trauma, focal neurologic deficits, or sensory changes. Her past medical history is significant for diabetes and hypertension for which she takes metformin and lisinopril, respectively. A physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following Figures is characteristic of her disease?

A. A
B. B
C. C
D. D

Answer: B. B

The figure that is characteristic of the woman's disease is option B, Alzheimer's disease. This is because the symptoms described, such as forgetfulness, confusion, and mood changes, are all common features of Alzheimer's disease. The fact that the husband noticed a gradual progression of these changes over time, rather than a sudden onset, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension, which can increase the risk of developing dementia, makes Alzheimer's disease a likely possibility."
413,"Question: As a lactation consultant, you are advising a new mother on the essential nutrients her newborn requires for optimal health. The baby was born at home and will only receive vaccinations, but no other medical care. Which vitamins should you recommend for the baby's healthy development?

Options:
A. Folic acid: This B vitamin is crucial for the baby's brain and spinal cord development during the first few months of life.
B. Vitamin K: This vitamin helps the baby's blood clotting mechanism function properly, which is essential for preventing bleeding during the early days of life.
C. Vitamin D: This vitamin is vital for the baby's bone development and immune system function.
D. Vitamin K and Vitamin D: Both of these vitamins are essential for the baby's overall health and development, and they work together to support the baby's immune system and bone growth.

Answer: D. Vitamin K and Vitamin D. As the baby was born at home and will only receive vaccinations, it is crucial to ensure they receive adequate amounts of these two essential vitamins to support their healthy development."
414,"Question: Infant Boy with Unknown Medical History Presented in Emergency Department

Options:

A. Congenital agenesis of an endocrine gland in the anterior neck: This condition is characterized by the absence of a gland in the anterior neck, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including a large protruding tongue, lethargy, and neglect. The absence of a gland can lead to hormonal imbalances, which can result in the physical exam findings observed in this case.

B. Excess growth hormone secondary to pituitary gland tumor: A tumor in the pituitary gland can cause excess growth hormone production, leading to a condition known as gigantism. This can result in a large protruding tongue, lethargy, and neglect. However, the patient's vital signs, including the heart rate and respiratory rate, are within normal limits, which suggests that this is unlikely to be the cause of their symptoms.

C. Type I hypersensitivity reaction: A severe allergic reaction can cause symptoms such as lethargy, neglect, and a large protruding tongue. However, the patient's temperature is within normal limits, which suggests that this is unlikely to be the cause of their symptoms.

D. Autosomal dominant mutation in the SERPING1 gene: This gene is responsible for the production of a protein involved in the development and maintenance of the tongue. A mutation in this gene can cause a variety of symptoms, including a large protruding tongue, lethargy, and neglect. However, the patient's age and medical history are not provided, making it difficult to determine if this is the likely cause of their symptoms.

Answer: A. Congenital agenesis of an endocrine gland in the anterior neck."
415,"Question: A 43-year-old man is rushed to the emergency department by his wife due to a 1-hour history of confusion and unusual behavior. She reports that he started acting agitated after eating wild berries they picked on their camping trip. His temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F). Physical examination reveals warm, dry skin and dry mucous membranes. His pupils are dilated and minimally reactive to light. His bowel sounds are decreased. The patient is admitted and pharmacotherapy is initiated with a drug that eventually resolves all of his symptoms. Which drug was most likely administered to the patient?

Options:
A. Scopolamine
B. Rivastigmine
C. Physostigmine
D. Neostigmine

Answer: C. Physostigmine.

Explanation: Physostigmine is an anticholinergic drug that is commonly used to treat symptoms of organophosphate poisoning, including confusion, agitation, and decreased bowel sounds. The patient's symptoms, including dilated and minimally reactive pupils, are consistent with organophosphate poisoning, which is a likely cause of their condition. While Scopolamine and Rivastigmine are also anticholinergic drugs, they are not typically used to treat organophosphate poisoning, and Neostigmine is not an anticholinergic drug. Therefore, Physostigmine is the most likely drug administered to the patient in this scenario."
416,"Question: A 65-year-old male presents to the physician with gross blood in his urine, without any associated pain. He has a 45-year history of smoking 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day. Urinalysis reveals positive findings on a dipstick, with 5 red blood cells (RBC) per high-power field (HPF). Following a cystoscopy, a suspicious lesion for malignancy is identified, and a biopsy confirms muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma. Before undergoing radical cystectomy, the patient is initiated on cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Which of the following is most likely associated with this chemotherapeutic regimen?

A. Gentamicin enhances toxicity risk: Cisplatin is known to have a potential for nephrotoxicity, which can be exacerbated by the use of aminoglycosides such as gentamicin. Therefore, option A is the most likely association.

B. Cardiotoxicity: Cisplatin can cause cardiotoxicity, including arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and QT prolongation. While not the most likely association in this case, it is still a potential side effect of cisplatin chemotherapy.

C. Myelosuppression: Cisplatin can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to a decrease in white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts. This can increase the risk of infection, anemia, and bleeding. However, myelosuppression is not the most likely association in this case, given the patient's presentation and the diagnosis of muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma.

D. Addition of mesna decreases drug toxicity: Mesna is a drug that can reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity associated with cisplatin chemotherapy. However, it is not typically used in the treatment of muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma. Therefore, option D is not the most likely association in this case."
417,"Question: A 34-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 18 weeks' gestation, comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She recently read about a genetic disorder that manifests with gait ataxia, kyphoscoliosis, and arrhythmia and is concerned about the possibility of her child inheriting the disease. There is no personal or family history of this disorder. The frequency of unaffected carriers in the general population is 1/100. Assuming the population is in a steady state without selection, what is the probability that her child will develop this disease?

A. 1/10,000
B. 1/20,000
C. 1/40,000
D. 1/200

Answer: C. 1/40,000

Explanation:

The probability of the child inheriting the genetic disorder can be calculated using the concept of carrier frequency in the general population. The frequency of unaffected carriers in the general population is 1/100, which means that for every 100 individuals in the population, one is a carrier of the disorder.

Since the mother is not a carrier and there is no personal or family history of the disorder, the probability of the child inheriting the disorder from the mother is zero. Therefore, the probability of the child developing the disorder is equal to the carrier frequency in the general population, which is 1/40,000.

So, the answer is C. 1/40,000."
418,"Question: A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of increasingly frequent headaches and reports that his hats and wedding ring no longer fit. What is this patient at greatest risk for?

Options:
A. Pheochromocytoma - This patient's symptoms of headaches and progressive enlargement of the tongue and jaw, along with the elevated insulin-like growth factor 1 levels, are more consistent with a diagnosis of acromegaly. Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder caused by excess growth hormone (GH) production, leading to tissue growth and enlargement, particularly in the head, face, and hands.

B. Medullary thyroid carcinoma - While the patient's symptoms of headaches and jaw enlargement could be indicative of a variety of conditions, the finding of mild cardiomegaly on chest radiograph suggests a possibility of a non-pulmonary malignancy, such as medullary thyroid carcinoma. This rare type of thyroid cancer often presents with symptoms related to excess production of calcitonin, a hormone produced by the thyroid gland.

C. Carpal tunnel syndrome - The patient's complaints of frequent headaches and difficulty fitting his hats and wedding ring may be related to compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, rather than any growth disorder. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition caused by compression of the median nerve in the wrist, leading to symptoms of pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand and fingers.

D. Osteosarcoma - While the patient's symptoms of headaches and jaw enlargement could be indicative of a variety of conditions, the finding of mild cardiomegaly on chest radiograph suggests a possibility of a malignancy, such as osteosarcoma. This type of bone cancer often affects the long bones of the body, particularly in children and young adults, and can cause symptoms related to bone pain, swelling, and fractures."
419,"Question: A 66-year-old homeless HIV-positive male presents with numbness in his hands and feet. The patient describes a gradual onset of symptoms over the past couple of weeks, starting with numbness in his fingertips and toes, which has now spread to involve his entire hands and feet. He has a history of HIV diagnosed many years ago, for which he has never sought treatment, as well as a long history of various illnesses, including chronic diarrhea. He is currently homeless and denies any alcohol or drug use. On physical examination, he is alert and oriented, with a cachectic body habitus and a BMI of 17 kg/m2. His tongue appears erythematous and smooth with loss of papillae, and there are decreased 2-point discrimination in his hands and feet bilaterally. Strength in his hands and feet is 4/5 bilaterally, and reflexes are absent in his ankles. His gait is slightly wide-based and ataxic, with a positive Romberg sign. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. Elevated levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA) - This is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Methylmalonic acid is a byproduct of metabolism that can accumulate in the body when there is a deficiency in vitamin B12 or kidney dysfunction. The patient's history of homelessness and lack of access to healthcare may have contributed to his vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to the elevated levels of methylmalonic acid and the symptoms he is experiencing.

B. Poorly controlled, undiagnosed diabetes - While the patient does not have classic symptoms of diabetes, such as increased thirst and urination, his tachycardia, tachypnea, and decreased 2-point discrimination in his hands and feet could be indicative of diabetes. However, the patient's history of homelessness and lack of access to healthcare may have made it difficult for him to receive proper diagnosis and treatment for diabetes.

C. Autoimmune reaction - The patient's symptoms could be related to an autoimmune reaction, such as peripheral neuropathy, which is a common complication of HIV infection. However, the patient's history of homelessness and lack of access to healthcare may have contributed to the progression of his condition.

D. Deposition of an insoluble protein - This is less likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms, as there is no evidence of any protein deposits in his body.

Answer: A. Elevated levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA)"
420,"Question: A 31-year-old woman presents with pruritic vesicles on the right side of her torso. She notes that the lesions appeared 2 days ago and have not improved. One day prior to their appearance, she says that she experienced a burning sensation in the affected area. The patient is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits. Upon physical examination, there are painful vesicles noted that are localized to the right T10 skin dermatome. Which of the following complications is associated with this patient’s likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Fever - This is not a complication associated with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), as the patient is afebrile.

B. Pneumonia - This is not a likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

C. Cerebellar ataxia - This is not a complication associated with postherpetic neuralgia.

D. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) - This is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. PHN is a common complication of shingles, a viral infection that causes a painful rash with sensory disturbances. The patient's burning sensation and painful vesicles on the right side of her torso are consistent with PHN.

Answer: D. Postherpetic neuralgia"
421,"Question: A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with fever, sore throat, runny nose, and rash. The patient's mother reports that symptoms started 3 days ago and that the rash first appeared on his face before spreading. The patient's family recently moved from Japan to the USA, and his vaccination history is not up to date according to US guidelines. His temperature is 38.3°C (101.0°F). On physical examination, a maculopapular rash is present on the trunk and extremities, along with significant bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and small petechial spots on the soft palate. Symptomatic treatment is provided, and the patient recovers in 3 days. Which of the following is the most likely causative agent responsible for this patient's condition?

A. Single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus (Answer)

Explanation: Based on the symptoms and physical examination findings described, the most likely causative agent responsible for this patient's condition is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, such as influenza or enterovirus. These viruses are common causes of respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses in children, and can cause fever, sore throat, runny nose, and rash. The patient's recent move to the USA from Japan and the fact that his vaccination history is not up to date according to US guidelines may also play a role in the development of the infection.

B. Cocci in chains (Incorrect)

Explanation: Cocci in chains are a type of bacteria, but they are not known to cause the symptoms described in this patient.

C. Double-stranded RNA virus (Incorrect)

Explanation: Double-stranded RNA viruses, such as herpesviruses and parvoviruses, can cause a range of illnesses in children, including respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, they are less likely to cause a maculopapular rash and cervical lymphadenopathy than a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus.

D. Single-stranded RNA retrovirus (Incorrect)

Explanation: Single-stranded RNA retroviruses, such as HIV, can cause a range of illnesses in children, including respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, they are less likely to cause a maculopapular rash and cervical lymphadenopathy than a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus."
422,"Question: A 65-year-old male engineer presents to the office with shortness of breath on exertion and a dry cough that he has had for about a year. He is a heavy smoker with a 25-pack-years history. His vitals include: heart rate 95/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and blood pressure 110/75 mm Hg. On examination, he presents with nail clubbing and bilateral and persistent crackling rales. The chest radiograph shows basal reticulonodular symmetric images, with decreased lung fields. The pulmonary function tests show the following: diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is 43% and reference SaO2 is 94% and 72%, at rest and with exercise, respectively. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Pleuropulmonary fibroelastosis - This is a rare condition that is characterized by the presence of excessive elastic tissue in the lungs, leading to shortness of breath and cough. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not fully align with this diagnosis.

B. Pulmonary Langerhans cells histiocytosis - This is a rare condition that is characterized by the accumulation of Langerhans cells in the lungs, leading to inflammation and scarring. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not fully align with this diagnosis.

C. Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis - This is a condition where the lungs react to inhaled antigens, leading to inflammation and scarring. However, the patient's history of heavy smoking and the presence of crackling rales on examination suggest that this diagnosis is less likely.

D. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - This is a condition where the lungs become scarred and stiff, leading to shortness of breath and cough. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis, and the low DLCO and reference SaO2 values on pulmonary function tests support this conclusion. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."
423,"Question: A 27-year-old pregnant woman presents to an obstetrician at 35 weeks gestation reporting the presence of a mucus plug in her vaginal discharge this morning. The obstetrician performs an examination and confirms that she is in labor. She was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. Her current antiretroviral therapy includes abacavir, lamivudine, and nevirapine. Her last HIV RNA level was 2,000 copies/mL 3 weeks ago. Which of the following anti-retroviral drugs should be administered intravenously to the woman during labor?

Options:

A. Enfuvirtide: This drug is not recommended for use during labor in HIV-infected pregnant women, as it has not been shown to be effective in preventing HIV transmission during labor and delivery.

B. Nevirapine: This drug is an NNRTI and can be used during labor in HIV-infected pregnant women to reduce the risk of vertical transmission. However, it should be administered intravenously and not orally, as the oral formulation is not effective during labor.

C. Rilpivirine: This drug is a NNRTI and can be used during labor in HIV-infected pregnant women to reduce the risk of vertical transmission. However, it is not recommended to use it during labor in women with a high viral load, as it may not be effective in reducing transmission.

D. Zidovudine: This drug is an NRTI and can be used during labor in HIV-infected pregnant women to reduce the risk of vertical transmission. It is the most commonly used drug during labor in HIV-infected pregnant women and has been shown to be effective in reducing transmission.

424,"Question: A 72-year-old obese man presents as a new patient to his primary care physician due to fatigue and shortness of breath after relocating to Denver. He is a former 50 pack-year smoker and has a history of lung cancer and a lobe removal. Additionally, he has a family history of a progressive restrictive lung disease. Laboratory values are as follows:

Oxygen tension in inspired air = 130 mmHg
Alveolar carbon dioxide tension = 48 mmHg
Arterial oxygen tension = 58 mmHg
Respiratory exchange ratio = 0.80
Respiratory rate = 20/min
Tidal volume = 500 mL

Which of the following mechanisms is consistent with these values?

A. High altitude
B. Hypoventilation
C. Pulmonary fibrosis
D. V/Q mismatch

Answer: A. High altitude

Explanation: The patient's high arterial oxygen tension (58 mmHg) and low alveolar carbon dioxide tension (48 mmHg) suggest that there is a diffusion limitation, which is consistent with high altitude. Additionally, the patient's respiratory exchange ratio (0.80) is also consistent with high altitude, as it is typically lower at high altitudes due to the reduced oxygen availability.

Option B, hypoventilation, is not consistent with the patient's laboratory values, as their respiratory rate is normal (20/min) and tidal volume is within the normal range (500 mL).

Option C, pulmonary fibrosis, is also not consistent with the patient's laboratory values, as there is no evidence of low arterial oxygen levels or high alveolar carbon dioxide levels, which are typical of pulmonary fibrosis.

Option D, V/Q mismatch, is also not consistent with the patient's laboratory values, as there is no evidence of a mismatch between the ventilation and perfusion of the lungs, which is typically seen in patients with V/Q mismatch."
425,"Question: A 40-year-old farmer from Ohio seeks evaluation at a clinic with complaints of a chronic cough, fevers, and anorexia of several months duration. On examination, he has generalized lymphadenopathy with hepatosplenomegaly. A chest radiograph reveals local infiltrates and patchy opacities involving all lung fields. Fine needle aspiration of an enlarged lymph node shows the presence of intracellular yeast. A fungal culture shows the presence of thick-walled spherical spores with tubercles and microconidia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Blastomycosis - This is a fungal infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis, which typically affects the lungs, skin, and eyes. While Blastomycosis can cause fever, cough, and weight loss, it is less likely to cause generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.

B. Histoplasmosis - This is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, which is commonly found in soil and decaying organic matter. Histoplasmosis can cause similar symptoms as Blastomycosis, including fever, cough, and weight loss, as well as lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. The presence of intracellular yeast on fine needle aspiration and the presence of thick-walled spherical spores with tubercles and microconidia on fungal culture are both consistent with Histoplasmosis.

C. Cryptococcosis - This is a fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, which can affect various parts of the body, including the lungs, central nervous system, and skin. While Cryptococcosis can cause fever, cough, and weight loss, it is less likely to cause generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.

D. Coccidioidomycosis - This is a fungal infection caused by Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii, which are commonly found in the southwestern United States. Coccidioidomycosis can cause similar symptoms as Blastomycosis and Histoplasmosis, including fever, cough, and weight loss, as well as lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. However, the presence of intracellular yeast on fine needle aspiration and the presence of thick-walled spherical spores with tubercles and microconidia on fungal culture are less consistent with Coccidioidomycosis.

Answer: B. Histoplasmosis."
426,"Question: A 67-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and benign prostatic hyperplasia presents with a 2-day history of sneezing and clear nasal discharge. He has had similar symptoms occasionally in the past. His current medications include metformin and tamsulosin. Examination of the nasal cavity reveals red, swollen turbinates. Which of the following medications would be the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?

Options:

A. Desloratadine: This medication is an antihistamine that can help alleviate nasal congestion and sneezing associated with allergic rhinitis.

B. Theophylline: This medication is a methylxanthine that can help relax the smooth muscle in the airways, making it easier to breathe and relieve nasal congestion.

C. Nizatidine: This medication is an H2-blocker that can help reduce nasal secretion and congestion by blocking the action of histamine on the nasal smooth muscle.

D. Amoxicillin: This antibiotic is not appropriate for treating a viral infection such as a cold or sinus infection, which are common causes of nasal congestion and sneezing.

Answer: A. Desloratadine."
427,"Question: A group of researchers is studying molecules and DNA segments that are critical for important cellular processes in eukaryotic cells. They have identified a region located about 28 bases upstream of the 5’ coding region. This region promotes the initiation of transcription by binding with transcription factors. Which of the following regions have these researchers most likely identified?

Options:

A. CAAT Box
B. Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (SnRNPs)
C. DNA methyltransferase
D. TATA Box

Answer: D. TATA Box

Explanation: The region identified by the researchers is likely to be the TATA Box, which is a specific DNA sequence located upstream of the 5’ coding region of a gene that plays a crucial role in the initiation of transcription. The TATA Box is recognized by the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription factor, which binds to the box and initiates transcription. Therefore, option D, TATA Box, is the most likely answer."
428,"Question: A 22-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia presents to the emergency room escorted by police. The officers state that the patient was found at a local mall, threatening to harm people in the parking lot, screaming at them, and chasing them. The patient states that those people were agents of the government sent to kill him. The patient is agitated and seems to be responding to internal stimuli. He refuses treatment and states that he wants to leave or he will hurt the hospital staff and other patients. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A. Let the patient leave against medical advice.

B. Wait for a psychiatrist to determine patient capacity.

C. Begin treatment due to patient's lack of decision making capacity.

D. Ask the police to escort the patient to jail.

Answer: C. Begin treatment due to patient's lack of decision making capacity.

Rationale: The patient's agitated state, delusional beliefs, and refusal of treatment indicate that they are not in a state to make informed decisions about their care. As the patient lacks decision-making capacity, it is important to begin treatment to address their psychiatric symptoms and ensure their safety. While option A may seem like a viable option, allowing the patient to leave against medical advice could put them at risk of harming themselves or others. Option D is not a feasible option as the patient is already under police escort and has been deemed a danger to themselves or others. Option B may be considered, but it is important to prioritize the patient's immediate safety and well-being by beginning treatment."
429,"Question: A 54-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to a 2-hour history of nausea and retrosternal chest pain. She has a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her current medications include atorvastatin, metformin, and lisinopril. She is diaphoretic. Her serum troponin level is 3.0 ng/mL (N: < 0.04). She undergoes cardiac catheterization. A photograph of coronary angiography performed prior to percutaneous coronary intervention is shown. An acute infarct associated with the finding on angiography is most likely to manifest with ST elevations in which of the following leads on ECG?

Options:
A. I, aVR - Incorrect. ST elevations in lead I (lead I is the lead that is closest to the heart's electrical activity) are less likely to be seen in an acute infarct associated with coronary angiography.
B. V3R–V6R - Incorrect. ST elevations in leads V3R-V6R (V3R is the lead located 3 positions right of the electrical axis, and V6R is the lead located 6 positions right of the electrical axis) are also less likely to be seen in an acute infarct associated with coronary angiography.
C. V1–V6 - Correct. An acute infarct associated with the finding on angiography is most likely to manifest with ST elevations in leads V1-V6 (V1 is the lead located closest to the electrical axis, and V6 is the lead located 6 positions away from the electrical axis).
D. V7–V9 - Incorrect. ST elevations in leads V7-V9 (V7 is the lead located 7 positions right of the electrical axis, and V9 is the lead located 9 positions right of the electrical axis) are also less likely to be seen in an acute infarct associated with coronary angiography.

Answer: C. V1–V6."
430,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 50-year-old man presents with severe headache, chest discomfort, and blurred vision. His headache has been persistent for 2 days and worsens at the end of the day. He also experiences nausea but has not vomited. The patient has a history of hypertension managed with beta-blockers until he recently self-discontinued treatment. His family history includes hypertension and an ST-elevation myocardial infarction in his father, and diabetes mellitus in his mother. Vital signs reveal elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Ophthalmoscopy shows arteriolar nicking and papilledema. The ECG is normal, but laboratory tests show elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, with 2+ protein on urinalysis. The patient is started on intravenous nitroprusside. Based on the findings, which of the following pathophysiological processes is most likely responsible for the neovascular changes observed in this patient?

Options:

A) Smooth muscle hyperplasia and duplication of the basement membrane
B) Cholesterol deposition in the vascular lumen
C) Weakening of vessel wall following endothelial injury
D) Protein deposition in the vascular lumen

Answer: A) Smooth muscle hyperplasia and duplication of the basement membrane"
431,"Question: A woman with coronary artery disease is starting to go for a walk. As she begins, her heart rate accelerates from a resting pulse of 60 bpm until it reaches a rate of 120 bpm, at which point she begins to feel a tightening in her chest. She stops walking to rest and the tightening resolves. This has been happening to her consistently for the last 6 months. Which of the following is a true statement?

Options:
A. Increasing the heart rate increases the amount of time spent during each cardiac cycle
B. Increasing the heart rate decreases the relative amount of time spent during diastole
C. Perfusion of the myocardium takes place primarily during systole
D. Perfusion of the myocardium takes place equally throughout the cardiac cycle

Answer: B. Increasing the heart rate decreases the relative amount of time spent during diastole

Explanation:

As the woman's heart rate increases from 60 bpm to 120 bpm, the amount of time spent during each cardiac cycle does not change. The duration of each cardiac cycle remains the same, regardless of the heart rate. However, the relative amount of time spent during diastole decreases as the heart rate increases. This is because the longer the diastole, the more blood is pumped into the ventricles during this phase, which can lead to a decrease in the amount of blood flow during systole. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
432,"Question: A 24-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a 3-day history of pain with urination, accompanied by abdominal pain and a constant feeling of needing to urinate. She has no past medical history or family history of note. She is currently sexually active with a new partner but has tested negative for sexually transmitted infections. On physical examination, suprapubic tenderness is noted, and a urine culture reveals gram-positive cocci. Which of the following organisms is most likely to be causing the patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. Catalase negative and beta-hemolytic
B. Catalase positive and coagulase positive
C. Coagulase negative and novobiocin resistant
D. Coagulase negative and novobiocin sensitive

Answer: C. Coagulase negative and novobiocin resistant

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and frequent urination, along with the presence of gram-positive cocci on urine culture, are consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by a coagulase-negative staphylococcus, which is resistant to novobiocin. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are a type of staphylococcus bacteria that do not produce coagulase, an enzyme that helps to clot blood. They are often found in the urinary tract and are a common cause of UTIs. The patient's symptoms and the urine culture results support this diagnosis."
433,"Question: A 19-year-old woman with a history of poorly controlled asthma presents to her pulmonologist for a follow-up visit. She was recently hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation. It is her third hospitalization in the past five years. She currently takes inhaled salmeterol and medium-dose inhaled budesonide. Her past medical history is also notable for psoriasis. She does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination reveals bilateral wheezes that are loudest at the bases. The patient’s physician decides to start the patient on zileuton. Which of the following is the most immediate downstream effect of initiating zileuton?

A. Decreased production of leukotrienes: Zileuton works by inhibiting the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, which is responsible for the production of leukotrienes. Leukotrienes are pro-inflammatory mediators that play a key role in the pathogenesis of asthma. By inhibiting the production of leukotrienes, zileuton can help to reduce the inflammation and airway obstruction associated with asthma.

B. Decreased IgE-mediated pro-inflammatory activity: While zileuton may also have some effects on IgE-mediated activity, the most immediate downstream effect of initiating zileuton is the decrease in leukotriene production.

C. Decreased mast cell degranulation: Zileuton may also have some effects on mast cell degranulation, but this is not the most immediate downstream effect of initiating zileuton.

D. Decreased signaling via the muscarinic receptor: Zileuton does not have any direct effects on muscarinic receptor signaling.

Answer: A. Decreased production of leukotrienes"
434,"Question: A 58-year-old woman visits her primary care physician with her husband. The husband reports that the patient has been acting strangely since a motor vehicle accident two months ago. She has been rude to him, their children, and her friends, and has lost interest in her usual hobbies. Which brain region is most likely involved in this patient's symptoms?

A. Broca's area: This region is responsible for speech production and language processing. While a lesion in this area could potentially cause difficulty with language processing, it is not the most likely region to be involved in a patient exhibiting rude behavior and loss of interest in hobbies.

B. Occipital lobe: The occipital lobe is involved in processing visual information, but it is not directly related to the patient's reported symptoms.

C. Temporal lobe: The temporal lobe is involved in processing and storing memories, as well as processing auditory information. While a lesion in this area could potentially cause memory loss or difficulty with auditory processing, it is not the most likely region to be involved in a patient exhibiting rude behavior and loss of interest in hobbies.

D. Frontal lobe: The frontal lobe is involved in a variety of higher-level cognitive functions, including decision-making, planning, and impulse control. A lesion in this area could potentially cause difficulty with these functions, which could explain the patient's rude behavior and loss of interest in hobbies. Therefore, the frontal lobe is the most likely region to be involved in this patient's symptoms.

Answer: D. Frontal lobe"
435,"Question: A 48-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with complaints of bloody diarrhea, mid-abdominal discomfort, and cramping for 3 days. She also has nausea, vomiting, and fever. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Rotavirus infection
B. C. difficile colitis
C. Bacillus cereus infection
D. Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection

Answer: D. Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection

The patient's symptoms of bloody diarrhea, mid-abdominal discomfort, and cramping, along with her recent consumption of raw oysters, are highly suggestive of Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection. Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a bacterium that can cause gastroenteritis, including diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and fever, in people who consume contaminated seafood. The patient's temperature of 37.5°C (99.6°F) and the presence of bloody stools also support this diagnosis.

While rotavirus infection, C. difficile colitis, and Bacillus cereus infection can also cause gastroenteritis, they are less likely given the patient's symptoms and recent food exposure. Rotavirus is more commonly associated with diarrhea in young children, while C. difficile colitis typically causes more persistent diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Bacillus cereus infection can cause diarrhea, but it is less likely to cause bloody stools.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection."
436,"Question: A 15-year-old adolescent presents to their pediatrician with progressive easy fatigability and exercises intolerance over the last several months. The patient was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. They are up to date on all vaccines and are meeting all developmental milestones. There is no history of palpitation, dyspnea, or lower limb edema. On physical examination, their vital signs are stable. On chest auscultation, a wide fixed split in the second heart sound is detected, and a medium-pitched systolic ejection murmur is present, which is best heard at the left middle and upper sternal border. A short mid-diastolic rumble is also audible over the lower left sternal border, which is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope. Which of the following findings is most likely to be present on this patient's echocardiogram?

A. Decreased right ventricular end-diastolic dimension
B. Anterior movement of ventricular septum during systole
C. Goose-neck deformity of left ventricular outflow tract
D. Increased left ventricular shortening fraction

Answer: B. Anterior movement of ventricular septum during systole

Explanation: Based on the physical examination findings, the patient is likely to have a diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). The wide fixed split in the second heart sound and the medium-pitched systolic ejection murmur are both consistent with MVP. On echocardiogram, the most likely finding to be present is the anterior movement of the ventricular septum during systole, which is a characteristic feature of MVP. Decreased right ventricular end-diastolic dimension, goose-neck deformity of left ventricular outflow tract, and increased left ventricular shortening fraction are not typically associated with MVP."
437,"Question: A 20-year-old female presents to the emergency department with squeezing right upper quadrant pain worse after eating. She has a history of a microcytic, hypochromic anemia with target cells. Physical exam shows severe tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant and a positive Murphy's sign. By genetic analysis, a single point mutation is detected in the gene of interest. Despite this seemingly minor mutation, the protein encoded by this gene is found to be missing a group of 5 consecutive amino acids though the amino acids on either side of this sequence are preserved. This point mutation is most likely located in which of the following regions of the affected gene?

Options:

A. Exon - The exons are the regions of the gene that contain the coding sequence for the protein. Since the point mutation results in the missing of a group of 5 consecutive amino acids, it is most likely located in an exon.

B. Intron - Introns are the non-coding regions of the gene that are located between the exons. Since the point mutation is not located in an intron, option B is incorrect.

C. Kozak consensus sequence - The Kozak consensus sequence is a specific sequence of nucleotides that is important for the proper translation of the mRNA into protein. However, the point mutation is not located in this region, so option C is incorrect.

D. Transcriptional promoter - The transcriptional promoter is the region of the gene where transcription is initiated. However, the point mutation is not located in this region, so option D is incorrect.

Answer: A. Exon"

439,"Question: A 25-year-old woman visits her physician due to persistent sadness that started 6 weeks after giving birth to her 9-month-old daughter. She has not returned to work and experiences difficulty staying asleep, is easily distracted, and has lost interest in activities she used to enjoy, such as cooking. She is also feeling too exhausted to cook and doesn't feel hungry much. The patient's pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes, and her child was born at 36 weeks' gestation without any medical issues. The patient is not sexually active, does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs, and her vital signs are within normal limits. She is alert and cooperative but makes little eye contact during the examination. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities. Which of the following conditions is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
B. Adjustment disorder
C. Major depressive disorder
D. Normal behavior

Answer: C. Major depressive disorder.

The patient's persistent sadness, difficulty staying asleep, and loss of interest in activities are all symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). The patient's history of gestational diabetes and the lack of a supportive relationship with the child's father may also contribute to her depression. While adjustment disorder and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder can also cause similar symptoms, the patient's history of gestational diabetes and the lack of a supportive relationship with the child's father suggest that MDD is the most likely diagnosis."
440,"Question: A 61-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after ingesting an unknown amount of medications in a suicide attempt. He experiences abdominal cramps, diarrhea, diaphoresis, and muscular weakness and spasms in his extremities. His temperature is 38.4°C (101.1°F), pulse is 51/min, respirations are 12/min and labored, and blood pressure is 88/56 mm Hg. Physical examination shows excessive salivation and tearing, and small pupils bilaterally. Treatment with atropine is initiated. Shortly after, most of his symptoms have resolved, but he continues to have muscular spasms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?

A. Carbachol: Carbachol is a cholinergic agent that can be used to treat myasthenia gravis, which is a disorder characterized by muscle weakness and spasms. However, in this case, the patient has already received atropine, which is a more appropriate treatment for anticholinergic toxicity. Therefore, carbachol is not the most appropriate next step in management of this patient.

B. Physostigmine: Physostigmine is an anticholinergic agent that can be used to treat anticholinergic toxicity. It can help to counteract the effects of anticholinergic drugs and can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. However, in this case, the patient has already received atropine, which is a more effective and safer treatment for anticholinergic toxicity. Therefore, physostigmine is not the most appropriate next step in management of this patient.

C. Pancuronium: Pancuronium is a depolarizing muscle relaxant that can be used to treat respiratory depression and muscle spasms. However, in this case, the patient does not have respiratory depression and the muscular spasms are not severe enough to require a muscle relaxant. Therefore, pancuronium is not the most appropriate next step in management of this patient.

D. Pralidoxime: Pralidoxime is a cholinergic agent that can be used to treat organophosphate poisoning, which is a type of anticholinergic toxicity. It can help to counteract the effects of organophosphates and can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. In this case, the patient has ingested an unknown amount of medications and has already received atropine, which is a more appropriate treatment for anticholinergic toxicity. Therefore, pralidoxime is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient.

Preoperative labs were all within normal limits. Which of the following drugs is most likely responsible for this patient’s abnormal laboratory findings?

A. Captopril
B. Nitrous oxide
C. Halothane
D. Ceftriaxone

Answer: C. Halothane

Explanation: Halothane is a general anesthetic that can cause metabolic changes, including increased blood glucose levels, decreased serum potassium levels, and increased serum sodium levels. The patient's abnormal laboratory findings, particularly the elevated serum glucose and decreased serum potassium levels, are consistent with halothane toxicity. Captopril, nitrous oxide, and ceftriaxone are unlikely to cause these specific metabolic changes."

Four months ago, she was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and started treatment with fluoxetine. Upon physical examination, no abnormalities are found. A diagnosis of upper respiratory infection is made and a medication is prescribed to alleviate her symptoms. Which of the following mechanisms of action should be avoided in this patient?

Options:

A. Disruption of mucoid disulfide bonds
B. Inhibition of H1 receptors
C. Reduction in secretion viscosity
D. Inhibition of NMDA glutamate receptors

Answer: D. Inhibition of NMDA glutamate receptors

Explanation: Fluoxetine, the medication the patient is currently taking for her depression, is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). SSRIs can have unintended consequences when used in patients with respiratory infections, as they can suppress the cough reflex and increase the risk of respiratory complications. Therefore, it is important to avoid inhibiting NMDA glutamate receptors in this patient, as it may exacerbate her respiratory symptoms."

446,"Question:

An investigator studying new drug delivery systems administers an aerosol containing 6.7-μm sized particles to a healthy subject via a nonrebreather mask. Which of the following is the most likely route of clearance of the particulate matter in this subject?

Options:

A. Trapping by nasal vibrissae
B. Expulsion by the mucociliary escalator
C. Phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages
D. Diffusion into pulmonary capillaries

Answer: B. Expulsion by the mucociliary escalator

Explanation:

When the aerosol containing 6.7-μm sized particles is administered to the subject via a nonrebreather mask, the most likely route of clearance is through the mucociliary escalator. The mucociliary escalator is a mechanism by which the body moves particles and debris out of the respiratory tract. The cilia in the respiratory epithelium beat in a coordinated manner to move particles and debris towards the nostrils, where they can be expelled from the body. In this scenario, the 6.7-μm sized particles are likely to be swept up by the mucociliary escalator and expelled from the body through the nostrils.

Option A, trapping by nasal vibrissae, is unlikely as the particles are too large to be trapped in the nasal vibrissae. Option C, phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages, is also unlikely as alveolar macrophages are not capable of phagocytosing particles of this size. Option D, diffusion into pulmonary capillaries, is also unlikely as the particles are too large to diffuse through the capillary walls and into the bloodstream."

451,"Question: A 64-hour-old baby girl is being evaluated for discharge. She was born by forceps-assisted vaginal delivery at 39 weeks gestation. The mother has no chronic medical conditions and attended all her prenatal visits. The mother’s blood type is A+. On day 1, the patient was noted to have a scalp laceration. Breastfeeding was difficult at first but quickly improved upon nurse assistance. The patient has had adequate wet diapers since birth. Upon physical examination, the resident notes the infant has scleral icterus and jaundiced skin. The scalp laceration noted on day 1 is intact without fluctuance or surrounding erythema. When the infant is slightly lifted from the bed and released, she spread out her arms, pulls them in, and exhibits a strong cry. Labs are drawn as shown below:

Blood type: AB-
Total bilirubin 8.7 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL

Six hours later, repeat total bilirubin is 8.3 mg/dL. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of the baby’s condition?

C. Observation

Explanation: The baby's total bilirubin levels have increased from 8.7 mg/dL to 8.3 mg/dL within a short period of six hours, indicating a possible case of bilirubin neonatal jaundice. Observation is the next best step in the management of the baby's condition as it allows for close monitoring of the baby's bilirubin levels and assessment of any potential complications. Coombs testing (A) is not necessary in this case as there is no evidence of hemolysis or blood group incompatibility. Exchange transfusion (B) may be considered if the baby's bilirubin levels remain high and show signs of bilirubin encephalopathy, but it is not a necessary step at this point. Phototherapy (D) may be used to treat jaundice, but it is not the next best step in the management of the baby's condition at this time."

The chest pain worsens upon inspiration and coughing. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 29/min. A dullness to percussion is noted at the left base of the lung, and an x-ray of the chest reveals blunting of the left costophrenic angle. Which of the following is the most likely finding in the evaluation of the pleural fluid?

A. Increased lymphocyte concentration
B. Decreased glucose concentration
C. Increased pH
D. Increased triglyceride concentration

Answer: B. Decreased glucose concentration"
453,"Question: A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain, describing it as tearing, which started 90 minutes prior and is now radiating to the upper back. The patient has a history of essential hypertension for 17 years and has smoked 20-30 cigarettes daily for the past 27 years. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 105/min, and blood pressure of 192/91 mm Hg in the right arm and 159/81 mm Hg in the left arm. Pulses are absent in the right leg and diminished in the left. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia, and a chest X-ray reveals a widened mediastinum. Transthoracic echocardiography shows an intimal flap arising from the ascending aorta and extending to the left subclavian artery. Intravenous morphine sulfate is administered. The next best step in managing this patient's condition is:

A. Intravenous metoprolol: Given the patient's history of hypertension and the elevated blood pressure readings, metoprolol can help to control the hypertension and reduce the workload on the heart, which may help to alleviate the chest pain.

B. Intravenous hydralazine: Hydralazine is an antihypertensive medication that can also help to dilate the blood vessels, which may improve blood flow to the affected area and reduce the pain.

C. Oral aspirin: Aspirin is an anti-platelet medication that can help to reduce the risk of cardiac ischemia and potentially alleviate the chest pain.

D. D-dimer: D-dimer is a blood test that can help to rule out the presence of a pulmonary embolism, which can cause similar chest pain symptoms.

Answer: A. Intravenous metoprolol"
454,"Question: The 28-year-old male intern on a trauma surgery service is feeling overwhelmed and stressed after a busy overnight shift. Despite not having enough time to prepare for morning rounds, the intern lashes out at the third-year medical student assisting them, criticizing their performance. Which ego defense mechanism is most relevant in this situation?

A. Displacement
B. Passive aggression
C. Projection
D. Reaction formation

Answer: A. Displacement

Explanation: The intern's criticism of the medical student is a form of displacement, as the intern is actually feeling frustrated and stressed about their own performance, or lack thereof, but instead directs those feelings towards the student. This is a common defense mechanism used to avoid acknowledging and dealing with one's own emotions, and instead, project them onto someone else."
455,"Question: A 6-year-old girl is brought to the physician due to a generalized pruritic rash lasting 3 days, with fluid oozing from some lesions. Her medical history includes a previous episode of bronchitis treated with azithromycin and no family history of serious illness. She has missed the last 5 days of elementary school and appears healthy. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Examination reveals a maculopapular rash with crusted lesions and vesicles on the entire body, including the scalp. Her laboratory results show hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL, white blood cell count 9800/mm3, and platelet count 319,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

A. Vitamin A therapy: Incorrect. Vitamin A therapy is not a recommended treatment for a pruritic rash, especially in a child with a history of bronchitis.

B. Rapid strep test: Incorrect. A rapid strep test is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have a sore throat or other symptoms suggestive of streptococcal infection.

C. Tzanck test: Incorrect. A Tzanck test is not a recommended diagnostic test for a pruritic rash in a child.

D. Calamine lotion: Correct. Calamine lotion can be applied topically to help soothe and dry the skin, reducing itching and inflammation. It is a common treatment for pruritic rashes in children."
456,"Question: A previously healthy 14-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother because of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 6 hours. Over the past 6 weeks, she has also had increased frequency of urination, and she has been drinking more water than usual. She has lost 6 kg (13 lb) over the same time period despite having a good appetite. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 125/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 94/58 mm Hg. She appears lethargic. Physical examination shows deep and labored breathing and dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is soft, and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Urine dipstick is positive for ketones and glucose. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?

A. Increased arterial pCO2
B. Increased arterial blood pH
C. Serum glucose concentration > 800 mg/dL
D. Decreased total body potassium

Answer: D. Decreased total body potassium

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and lethargy, along with her recent weight loss and increased urination, suggest that she may be experiencing dehydration due to excessive fluid loss. The presence of ketones and glucose in her urine further supports this diagnosis. Decreased total body potassium is a common finding in dehydration, as potassium is an electrolyte that is lost in excessive urine. Therefore, it is the most likely finding to be revealed by further evaluation."
457,"Question: A 44-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a headache, vertigo, confusion, and dyspnea. A relevant history cannot be obtained from the patient due to her confused state, and her husband reports that she was cleaning the kitchen earlier today when the curtains caught on fire from the stove's flame. Her vital signs are as follows: pulse 100/min, respirations 20/min, blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg, oxygen saturation 97% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is oriented x 0, and her skin has a bright cherry-red color. Laboratory tests reveal: pH 7.35, PaO2 90 mm Hg, pCO2 40 mm Hg, HCO3- 26 mEq/L, SpO2 97%, and blood lactate 11 mmol/L. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

A. Anemia
B. Carbon monoxide poisoning
C. Cyanide poisoning
D. Polycythemia

Answer: C. Cyanide poisoning

Rationale: The patient's confused state, bright cherry-red skin color, and elevated blood lactate levels are all consistent with cyanide poisoning. The husband's report of a kitchen fire and the patient's inability to provide a coherent history further support this diagnosis. Carbon monoxide poisoning and anemia are less likely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Polycythemia is an unlikely diagnosis in this patient."
458,"Question: A 6-month-old infant girl is brought by her parents to the emergency room due to abnormal jerky movements of the upper and lower limbs for the past month. When questioned about her birth history, the parents mention that a prenatal scan of the fetal heart revealed that the patient had a mass in the left ventricle, which led to the diagnosis of a neurocutaneous disorder in the child. Which of the following findings is a characteristic cutaneous finding associated with this young patient’s disorder?

Options:
A. Ash-leaf spots: This is a characteristic cutaneous finding associated with neurocutaneous disorders, particularly those caused by genetic mutations. Ash-leaf spots are small, irregularly shaped patches of skin that are lighter than the surrounding skin, giving them a ""ash-leaf"" appearance.

B. Cafe-au-lait spots: These are flat, light-brown patches of skin that can appear anywhere on the body. They are often present at birth or develop in the first few years of life and can be associated with various neurocutaneous disorders, including neurofibromatosis type 1.

C. Cavernous hemangioma of the skin: These are benign tumors that develop in the skin's blood vessels. They can cause skin thickening and discoloration, and may be associated with other symptoms such as pain or itching.

D. Port-wine stain: This is a flat, reddish-purple birthmark that can appear on the skin, often on one side of the face or body. It can be associated with various neurological disorders, including Sturge-Weber syndrome.

Answer: A. Ash-leaf spots"
459,"Question: A 78-year-old man dies suddenly from complications of acute kidney failure. An autopsy is performed and microscopic evaluation of the kidneys shows pale, swollen cells in the proximal convoluted tubules. Microscopic evaluation of the liver shows similar findings. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of these findings?

Options:
A. Impaired Na+/K+-ATPase pump activity: The Na+/K+-ATPase pump is essential for maintaining the proper balance of sodium and potassium ions in the body. Without proper function of this pump, sodium ions can accumulate in the proximal convoluted tubules, leading to cell swelling and damage. This can ultimately result in acute kidney failure. Therefore, option A is the most likely underlying mechanism of the findings.

B. Cytoplasmic triglyceride accumulation: Triglycerides are a type of lipid that can accumulate in the cytoplasm of cells, particularly in the kidneys and liver. When triglycerides accumulate in the proximal convoluted tubules and liver, it can cause cell damage and lead to acute kidney failure. However, this is not the most likely underlying mechanism of the findings in this case, as the patient did not have a history of metabolic disorders or obesity.

C. Double-stranded DNA breakage: DNA damage can occur due to various factors, including exposure to toxins, radiation, or oxidative stress. Double-stranded DNA breaks can lead to cell death and organ dysfunction, including acute kidney failure. However, there is no evidence to suggest that double-stranded DNA breakage occurred in this case.

D. Free radical formation: Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage cellular components, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. Free radical formation can lead to cell damage and death, which can contribute to acute kidney failure. However, there is no evidence to suggest that free radical formation occurred in this case.

Answer: A. Impaired Na+/K+-ATPase pump activity."
460,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 27-year-old man visits the emergency department complaining of general weakness and fatigue that has been persisting for several days. He also reports difficulty taking care of himself due to his extreme fatigue. The patient has a history of IV drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and minor traumas associated with intoxication. His temperature is 104°F (40°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A heart murmur is detected during the cardiac exam. The patient is admitted to the inpatient floor and treated appropriately. However, over the next few days, the patient experiences profuse and watery diarrhea, as well as severe abdominal pain. Which of the following is most likely to be the underlying diagnosis?

Options:

A. Ascitic fluid infection
B. Pseudomembranes of fibrin
C. Increased osmotic load
D. Schistocytes on peripheral smear

Answer: B. Pseudomembranes of fibrin.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of profuse and watery diarrhea, as well as severe abdominal pain, are consistent with pseudomembranes of fibrin, which are a common complication of alcohol-related liver disease. The patient's history of IV drug abuse and alcohol abuse increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Ascitic fluid infection, increased osmotic load, and schistocytes on peripheral smear are less likely to be the underlying diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and medical history."
461,"Question: A 45-year-old man presents for his annual checkup. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 that is well-controlled with diet. In addition, he was admitted to this hospital 1-year ago for a myocardial infarction (MI). The patient reports a 40-pack-year smoking history. However, after his MI, his doctors informed him about how detrimental smoking was to his heart condition. Since then, he has made efforts to cut down and now, for the last six months, has stopped smoking. He says he used to use smoking as a means of dealing with his work and family stresses. He now attends wellness sessions at work and meditates early every morning before the family wakes up. Which of the following stages of the transtheoretical model is this patient most likely in?

Option A: Maintenance

The patient has made significant progress in reducing their smoking habit and has been able to maintain their progress for the last six months. This aligns with the Maintenance stage of the transtheoretical model, where individuals have made significant changes to their behavior and are able to maintain those changes over time. The patient's continued attendance at wellness sessions and meditation practice also demonstrate their commitment to their health and well-being, which is a hallmark of the Maintenance stage."
462,"Question: A 62-year-old male presents to the physician with difficulty initiating urination, terminal dribbling of urine, and bone pain for the past 3 months. His vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows tenderness over the lower lumbar vertebrae and the right pelvis. The digital rectal exam (DRE) reveals a prostate size equivalent to 2 finger pads with a hard nodule. The laboratory tests show the following results:

Serum Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 15 ng/mL
Testosterone 350 ng/mL (N=270–1070 ng/mL)

The prostate biopsy confirms the presence of prostate cancer with aggressive histologic features. The MRI shows local extension of the tumor. The radionuclide bone scan shows multiple metastatic sites.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Active surveillance
B. Androgen deprivation therapy
C. Chemotherapy
D. Radical prostatectomy

Answer: B. Androgen deprivation therapy"
463,"Question: A 19-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of blood-speckled stools and a protruding rectal mass. He has no abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, or fever. His mother has inflammatory bowel disease. On examination, multiple small hyperpigmented maculae are noted on the lips, buccal mucosa, palms, and soles. The abdomen is soft with no organomegaly. Rectal examination reveals a 4-cm pedunculated polyp with superficial excoriations on the mucosa. A colonoscopy shows 14 polyps, and a biopsy shows hamartomatous mucosal polyps. Based on these findings, the patient's diagnosis is most likely associated with which of the following conditions?

A. Medulloblastoma: This is a rare type of brain cancer that typically affects children. While it can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, it is not typically associated with the findings described in the patient's presentation.

B. Enterovesicular fistula: This is a rare condition where there is a communication between the intestine and the skin, leading to the passage of enteric contents into the skin. While this can cause skin manifestations, it is not typically associated with the presence of polyps in the colon.

C. Pancreatic carcinoma: This is a type of cancer that affects the pancreas and can cause a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, including blood-speckled stools and a protruding rectal mass. The presence of multiple polyps in the colon, as well as the patient's family history of inflammatory bowel disease, suggest a higher likelihood of this diagnosis.

D. Esophageal varices: These are dilated veins in the esophagus that can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing and bleeding. While they can be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, they are not typically associated with the findings described in the patient's presentation.

Answer: C. Pancreatic carcinoma"
464,"Question: A 28-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of persistent joint pain and fatigue over the past two months. The patient reports that the pain migrates from one joint to another, with no history of trauma or recent infections. The patient also mentions subjective fevers. Given the patient's occupation as a logger, there is a possibility of exposure to a tick-borne illness. What is the most likely etiologic agent of this patient's disease?

Options:
A. A gram-negative diplococci - This option is incorrect as there is no evidence to suggest that a gram-negative bacterium is the cause of the patient's symptoms.
B. A spirochete - This option is the most likely answer. Spirochetes are long, spiral-shaped bacteria that can cause chronic infections, including Lyme disease, which is transmitted through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis). The patient's symptoms of persistent joint pain and fatigue, as well as the possibility of exposure to ticks in their occupation, make Lyme disease a likely diagnosis.
C. A gram-positive, spore-forming rod - This option is incorrect as there is no evidence to suggest that a gram-positive bacterium is the cause of the patient's symptoms.
D. A gram-positive cocci in chains - This option is incorrect as there is no evidence to suggest that a gram-positive bacterium in chains is the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Answer: B. A spirochete."

466,"Question: A 75-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath and a productive cough with blood-tinged sputum for the past 24 hours, along with a history of muscle aches, headache, fever, and clear rhinorrhea for the past 5 days. Which of the following pathogens is the most likely cause of her symptoms?

Options:
A. Mycobacterium tuberculosis - This bacterium can cause a chronic, progressive lung disease with symptoms similar to those described, including cough, fever, and weight loss. However, the patient's recent history of muscle aches and clear rhinorrhea suggest that Mycobacterium tuberculosis is less likely to be the cause.

B. Staphylococcus aureus - Staphylococcus aureus can cause pneumonia, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient's age and recent history of muscle aches and fever also support this diagnosis.

C. Legionella pneumoniae - Legionella pneumoniae can cause a severe, community-acquired pneumonia known as legionellosis, which can present with symptoms similar to those described. However, the patient's age and recent history of muscle aches and fever suggest that Legionella pneumoniae is less likely to be the cause.

D. Streptococcus agalactiae - Streptococcus agalactiae, or group B streptococcus, can cause pneumonia, including CAP, but the patient's age and recent history of muscle aches and fever suggest that this pathogen is less likely to be the cause.

Answer: B. Staphylococcus aureus."
467,"Sure! Here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A team of researchers discovers a novel enzyme that breaks glutamate-valine bonds in a bacterial toxin. The enzyme's substrate binding site has a high concentration of aspartate. The researchers test the enzyme's activity on two serum samples, one with a standard condition and the other with a modified condition. They measure the enzyme's Vmax (maximum rate of reaction) and Km (Michaelis constant) for each serum sample. Based on the data, which of the following conditions in the test serum is most likely responsible for the observed differences in enzyme activity?

A. Higher pH in the test serum
B. Increased enzyme concentration in the test serum
C. Presence of a reversible competitive inhibitor in the test serum
D. Presence of an irreversible competitive inhibitor in the test serum

Choose the answer that best explains the observed differences in enzyme activity between the control and test serum samples."
468,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 41-year-old woman undergoes elective cholecystectomy under general anesthesia two hours ago. She is now evaluated for decreased mental status. What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?

Options:

A. Low cytochrome P450 activity
B. High minimal alveolar concentration
C. High lipid solubility
D. Low blood solubility

Answer: C. High lipid solubility

Explanation: The patient's decreased mental status, lack of response to sternal rub, and absent gag reflex are consistent with a high lipid solubility, which can cause the anesthetic to persist in the body for a longer time than expected. This is more likely to occur with agents that have a high lipid solubility, such as propofol or benzodiazepines. The other options are less likely to cause these symptoms."
469,"Question: A 29-year-old G2P1001 presents to her obstetrician's office complaining of dyspareunia. She endorses ongoing vaginal dryness resulting in uncomfortable intercourse over the last month. In addition, she has noticed a gritty sensation in her eyes as well as difficulty tasting food and halitosis. She denies pain with urination and defecation. Her medications include a daily multivitamin, folic acid, and over-the-counter eye drops. The patient's temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 121/80 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Physical exam is notable for a well-appearing female with fullness in the bilateral cheeks and reduced salivary pool. For which of the following is the patient's fetus at increased risk?

A. Macrosomia

The patient's symptoms of dyspareunia and gritty sensation in her eyes, difficulty tasting food, and halitosis could be indicative of a condition called dry mouth or xerostomia, which is a common side effect of several medications, including some used during pregnancy. Dry mouth can lead to an increased risk of macrosomia, which is a condition where the fetus is larger than average and may require a cesarean section delivery due to fetal distress during labor. Therefore, option A, Macrosomia, is the correct answer."
470,"Question: A 23-year-old woman seeks consultation at the outpatient OB/GYN clinic as a new patient, desiring to initiate contraception. She has no significant medical history, family history, or social history. Her vital signs are normal, with a blood pressure of 118/78 mm Hg, pulse of 73/min, and respiratory rate of 16/min, and she is afebrile. The physical examination is unremarkable. She has researched various contraceptive methods and wants to know which is the most effective. Which of the following methods should be recommended?

Options:

A. Intrauterine device (IUD) - This long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method is highly effective, with a failure rate of less than 1% when used correctly. It provides continuous contraception for up to 3-10 years, depending on the type, and requires minimal user involvement.

B. NuvaRing - This vaginal ring contains a progestin hormone that prevents ovulation and thickens cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg. It is also a LARC method and is 99% effective with proper use.

C. Male condoms - While not as effective as IUDs or NuvaRing, condoms are a good option for those who want a non-hormonal method of contraception. They are 82-98% effective with proper use, and can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

D. Diaphragm with spermicide - This method involves placing a silicone dome over the cervix to physically block sperm. It is less effective than IUDs or NuvaRing, with a failure rate of 12-20% without spermicide and 20-30% with spermicide. It requires more user involvement and must be used with spermicide to be effective.

Answer: A. Intrauterine device (IUD)"
471,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 68-year-old man visits his doctor for his annual physical examination. He has no current health complaints. His past medical history is unremarkable. He reveals a 30-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or drug use. During the examination, the doctor notices that his mucous production is thicker and worse in the morning when he coughs. A non-contrast CT scan of his chest is performed, and a 2 cm nodule is identified in his upper lobe of the left lung near the left main bronchus. The doctor informs the patient that further testing is required to rule out the possibility of cancer. The patient is surprised by this news because he has never experienced any concerning symptoms. The doctor explains that lung cancers often don't produce noticeable symptoms until they have progressed significantly, which is why patients with risk factors are screened earlier than the general public. Which of the following concepts is the doctor describing to the patient?

A. The tendency for people to overestimate the likelihood of a positive test result (Surveillance bias)
B. The influence of another variable on the observed relationship between the exposure and the outcome (Confounding bias)
C. The period of time between exposure and the appearance of symptoms (Latent period)
D. The difference between the time of exposure and the time of diagnosis (Lead time bias)

Answer: C. Latent period"
472,"Question: A 65-year-old woman presents to her physician with a persistent and debilitating cough and chest pain accompanied by shortness of breath for the past week. The patient has a history of breast carcinoma 10 years ago treated with mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation, a hospitalization a month ago for pneumonia that was treated with antibiotics, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. She is currently taking chlorthalidone and metformin. The patient's respiratory rate is 20/min and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. Her serum sodium is 140 mmol/L, serum potassium is 3.8 mmol/L, and serum calcium is 12.2 mg/dL. A chest X-ray is performed, which shows a large mass in the right lung. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Bacterial pneumonia
B. Small cell carcinoma lung
C. Squamous cell carcinoma lung
D. Tuberculosis

Answer: C. Squamous cell carcinoma lung.

The patient's history of breast carcinoma and recent hospitalization for pneumonia suggest that she may have a higher likelihood of developing lung cancer. The chest X-ray shows a large mass in the right lung, which is consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. While bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis can also cause chest pain and cough, the X-ray findings are more consistent with a lung tumor. Small cell carcinoma lung is less likely given the patient's age and history of radiation therapy for breast cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer in older adults and is often associated with smoking, which the patient's husband has been doing for 30 years."
473,"Question: A 16-year-old woman with no known past medical history and non-significant social and family histories presents to the outpatient clinic for an annual wellness checkup. She has no complaints, and her review of systems is negative. She is up to date on her childhood and adolescent vaccinations. The patient's blood pressure is 120/78 mm Hg, pulse is 82/min, respiratory rate is 16/min, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On further questioning, she discloses that she has recently become sexually active and enquires about any necessary screening tests for cervical cancer. What is the appropriate recommendation regarding cervical cancer screening in this patient?

A. Begin 2-year interval cervical cancer screening via Pap smear today: Incorrect. While the patient is sexually active, she is only 16 years old, which is too young for routine Pap smear screening. The American Cancer Society recommends that women should not begin routine cervical cancer screening until they are 21 years old.

B. Begin 3-year interval cervical cancer screening via Pap smear at age 21: Correct! The patient is within the recommended age range for initiating cervical cancer screening, and a 3-year interval for Pap smear screening is appropriate for sexually active women.

C. Begin 5-year interval cervical cancer screening via Pap smear at age 21: Incorrect. While the patient is within the recommended age range for initiating cervical cancer screening, a 5-year interval for Pap smear screening is not appropriate for sexually active women.

D. Offer to administer the HPV vaccine so that Pap smears can be avoided: Incorrect. While the HPV vaccine can help prevent cervical cancer, it is not a substitute for routine Pap smear screening. The patient should still undergo regular Pap smear screening to detect any abnormal cells in the cervix.

Answer: B. Begin 3-year interval cervical cancer screening via Pap smear at age 21."
474,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 16-year-old Mexican female presents with symptoms of the common cold after the patient's respiratory epithelial cells were infected with Rhinovirus. Due to the presence of the virus, her respiratory epithelial cells begin producing interferon. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be an outcome of the activation of the interferon response?

Options:
A. Decreased viral replication within the cell
B. A rhinovirus-specific, cell-mediated immune response
C. Upregulation of NK cell ligands on the infected cell
D. Activation of NK cells

Answer: B. A rhinovirus-specific, cell-mediated immune response.

Explanation: The activation of the interferon response in response to Rhinovirus infection is primarily focused on antiviral mechanisms, rather than a specific immune response to the virus. While interferon can activate immune cells such as natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells, the activation of these cells is not the primary outcome of interferon production in this scenario. Therefore, option B is the least likely outcome of the activation of the interferon response in this case."

A. P-ANCA vasculitis of small vessels
B. Microthrombi occluding the vasculature
C. Gram-negative cocci infection
D. Deposition of IgA immune complexes

Answer: D. Deposition of IgA immune complexes.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and swelling of the ankles and limited range of motion are consistent with IgA nephropathy, also known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura. The presence of non-blanching raised erythematous papules on the lower extremities is also characteristic of this condition. The positive test for occult blood in the stool and the abnormal urinalysis findings support the diagnosis. The other options are less likely causes based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results."
476,"Question: An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician due to a 7-day history of a progressively worsening cough. Which of the following are the most appropriate recommendations for this family?

A. Administer oral azithromycin to the baby and father, and Tdap vaccination to the father.
B. Administer oral azithromycin to all family members and Tdap vaccination to the father and mother.
C. Administer oral erythromycin to all family members and Tdap vaccination to the father.
D. Administer oral azithromycin to all family members and Tdap vaccination to the father.

Answer: B. Administer oral azithromycin to all family members and Tdap vaccination to the father and mother.

Rationale:

The patient's symptoms of a progressively worsening cough and occasional vomiting after coughing episodes are concerning for pertussis, a contagious bacterial infection. The fact that the mother was vaccinated against pertussis 11 years ago is a positive aspect, but it is important to ensure that all family members, including the baby and father, are up-to-date on their vaccinations to prevent the spread of the infection.

Administering oral azithromycin to all family members can help manage the symptoms of pertussis, as it is an effective antibiotic against the bacteria that cause the infection. Additionally, Tdap vaccination for the father and mother can provide protection against pertussis and help prevent its spread within the family.

While option A suggests administering oral azithromycin to the baby and father, this may not be necessary as the baby is too young to receive vaccinations and the father's vaccination records are unavailable. Option C suggests administering oral erythromycin to all family members, but this antibiotic is not as effective against pertussis as azithromycin. Option D suggests administering oral azithromycin to all family members, but this is similar to option B and does not take into account the father's vaccination records."
477,"Question: A 69-year-old male presents to the emergency department with slurred speech and an inability to use his right arm after eating dinner. He was given thrombolytics and is being managed on the neurology floor. Three days later, he complains of worsening neck pain and is given ibuprofen. Laboratory values are ordered and return as indicated below:

Serum:
Na+: 130 mEq/L
K+: 3.7 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen: 7 mg/dL
Glucose: 70 mg/dL
Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
Ca2+: 9.7 mg/dL

Urine:
Appearance: dark
Glucose: negative
WBC: 0/hpf
Bacterial: none
Na+: 320 mEq/L/24 hours

His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse is 95/min, blood pressure is 129/70 mmHg, respirations are 10/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

A. Fluid restriction: The patient's serum sodium level is 130 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. However, the patient's urine output and fluid balance should be closely monitored to prevent fluid overload, which can exacerbate neurological symptoms. Therefore, fluid restriction is not the best next step in management.

B. Oral salt tablets: The patient's serum sodium level is normal, and there is no indication for administering oral salt tablets.

C. Demeclocycline: Demeclocycline is an antibiotic that is not indicated for the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

D. Conivaptan: Conivaptan is a vasopressin receptor antagonist that is not indicated for the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

Answer: B. Oral salt tablets."
478,"Question: A 59-year-old woman is admitted to the intensive care unit after surgery following a motor vehicle collision. She has received a total of four units of packed red blood cells. Physical examination shows dry mucous membranes and flat neck veins. Serum studies show a creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL and urine microscopy shows granular, muddy-brown casts. A renal biopsy specimen is obtained and examined under light microscopy. Which of the following reversible cellular changes is most likely to be present?

Options:

A. Vacuolization of the endoplasmic reticulum - This is a less likely option, as vacuolization of the endoplasmic reticulum is typically seen in cases of cellular stress caused by toxins or infections, rather than in response to blood transfusions.

B. Rupture of lysosomes - This option is also unlikely, as lysosomal rupture is typically associated with cellular injury or toxicity, rather than with blood transfusions.

C. Swelling of the mitochondria - This is the most likely option, as swelling of the mitochondria can occur as a result of increased metabolic demand or oxidative stress, which can be triggered by the administration of blood transfusions.

D. Release of cytochrome C - This option is not relevant to the scenario provided, as cytochrome C is a protein that is involved in cellular respiration and is not typically released in response to blood transfusions.

Answer: C. Swelling of the mitochondria."
479,"Question: A 43-year-old man presents to the physician with left flank pain and nausea lasting 2 hours, accompanied by radiation to his groin. He has experienced intermittent pain in both flanks and recurrent joint pain in his toes, ankles, and fingers over the past year, with no prior medical attention. His vital signs are normal, and physical examination reveals marked tenderness in both costovertebral areas. A CT scan of his abdomen shows multiple small kidney stones and a 7-mm left distal ureteral stone. A biopsy of his external ear is likely to reveal:

A. Cholesterol
B. Ammonium magnesium phosphate
C. Monosodium urate
D. Calcium oxalate

Answer: C. Monosodium urate.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of left flank pain, nausea, and radiation to his groin are consistent with a kidney stone, specifically an upper tract stone made of monosodium urate. This is supported by the CT scan findings of multiple small kidney stones and a 7-mm left distal ureteral stone. Monosodium urate is the most common type of kidney stone, accounting for approximately 8% of all stones. It is formed through the concentration of uric acid in the urine, which can occur due to various factors such as dehydration, certain medical conditions, or genetic predisposition. The patient's history of intermittent flank pain and recurrent joint pain in his toes, ankles, and fingers also suggest the possibility of a connective tissue disorder, such as gout, which is often associated with monosodium urate kidney stones."
480,"Question: A 2-month-old infant boy is brought to the clinic for a well-child check. Mom reports a healthy pregnancy with no complications. During the prenatal check, the ultrasound technician noticed ""some white deposits in his brain."" Although Mom was not concerned, the baby was delivered at 38 weeks of gestation during a home birth. When asked if there were any issues with the birthing process, Mom mentioned that he was small and had ""blue dots all over."" Physical exam was unremarkable except for the absence of object tracking. What other finding would you expect?

A. Continuous machine-like murmur: This is a common finding in newborns, especially those who were born prematurely or had a difficult delivery. A continuous machine-like murmur can be caused by a variety of factors, including patent ductus arteriosus, a congenital heart defect that affects the blood flow between the heart and the lungs.

B. Hutchinson teeth: Also known as ""natal teeth,"" these are small, pointed teeth that can appear in newborns. They are usually present at birth and can be a normal variation in some cases. However, in some instances, they may be a sign of a genetic disorder or infection.

C. Sensorineural hearing loss: This is a type of hearing loss that affects the inner ear and is present from birth. It can be caused by genetic factors, infections during pregnancy, or exposure to loud noises during delivery. Sensorineural hearing loss can lead to difficulty hearing or responding to sounds, and may require intervention and treatment.

D. Skin vesicles: These are small, fluid-filled bumps that can appear on the skin, usually in newborns. They are usually harmless and can resolve on their own within a few days. However, in some cases, they can be a sign of a viral infection or other underlying condition."
481,"Question: A 39-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus presents with a 2-month history of fatigue and hair loss. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years and her only medication is insulin. Her vital signs are as follows: pulse 59/min, blood pressure 102/76 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals dry skin, coarse hair, and a nontender, diffuse neck swelling in the anterior midline. Which of the following is most likely to be found during further evaluation of this patient?

A. Increased uptake on a radioactive iodine scan
B. Antimicrosomal antibodies in the bloodstream
C. DR5 subtype on HLA haplotype analysis
D. B8 subtype on HLA haplotype analysis

Answer: B. Antimicrosomal antibodies in serum

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fatigue and hair loss, along with the physical examination findings of dry skin and coarse hair, suggest the possibility of an autoimmune disorder. Antimicrosomal antibodies are commonly found in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, and their presence in the patient's serum would support this diagnosis. The other options are less likely to be found in this patient."
482,"Question: An 11-year-old African American boy is brought to your office by his parents with a 1-day history of severe left hip pain. It is too painful for him to walk without support. He took ibuprofen, which brought no relief. He has had no chills or sweats. Similar painful episodes in the past required multiple hospitalizations. He returned from a trip to Kenya with his family 2 months ago. His vaccinations are up-to-date. His temperature is 38°C (100.4° F), pulse is 100/min, blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae. The abdomen is soft with no organomegaly. Passive movement of the hip causes severe pain. There is tenderness on palpation, but no swelling, warmth, or erythema of the hip. His laboratory studies show a hematocrit of 25% and leukocyte count of 14 000/mm3. A peripheral blood smear would most likely show:

A. Trophozoites: There are no trophozoites present on the peripheral blood smear.

B. Decreased number of thrombocytes: The leukocyte count shows a normal number of thrombocytes, so this option is not correct.

C. Howell-Jolly bodies: The peripheral blood smear shows the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies, which are a characteristic finding in patients with malaria.

D. Gram-negative bacilli: There is no evidence of gram-negative bacilli on the peripheral blood smear.

Answer: C. Howell-Jolly bodies"
483,"Question: A newborn girl is rushed to the neonatal ICU after an emergency cesarean section due to unstable vital signs after delivery. The pregnancy was complicated due to oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia. Gestation was at 38 weeks. APGAR scores were 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. The newborn’s temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the blood pressure is 60/40 mm Hg, the respiratory rate is 45/min, and the pulse is 140/min. Physical examination reveals irregularly contoured bilateral abdominal masses. Abdominal ultrasound reveals markedly enlarged echogenic kidneys (5 cm in the vertical dimension) with multiple cysts in the cortex and medulla. This patient is at highest risk of which of the following complications?

A. Subarachnoid hemorrhage
B. Portal hypertension
C. Recurrent UTI
D. Self mutilation

Answer: B. Portal hypertension

Explanation: The patient's abnormal abdominal ultrasound findings, including markedly enlarged echogenic kidneys with multiple cysts in the cortex and medulla, are consistent with a diagnosis of nephroblastoma, a type of Wilms' tumor. This is a malignant tumor that originates in the kidney and is most commonly seen in children under the age of 5. The patient's age, abnormal ultrasound findings, and history of oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. Portal hypertension is a common complication of Wilms' tumor, as the tumor can cause obstruction of the hepatic veins and portal vein, leading to increased pressure in the portal system. Therefore, the patient is at highest risk of developing portal hypertension. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, recurrent UTI, and self-mutilation are not relevant to this patient's condition."
484,"Question: An 11-month-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of recurrent otitis media since birth. The patient’s immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 5th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows multiple petechiae and several eczematous lesions over the scalp and extremities. The remainder of the examination reveals no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 9,600/mm3 (61% neutrophils and 24% lymphocytes), a platelet count of 29,000/mm3, and an increased serum IgE concentration. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Chédiak-Higashi syndrome - This rare genetic disorder is characterized by recurrent infections, eczematous lesions, and a deficiency in the immune system. However, the patient's age and the presence of eczematous lesions on the scalp and extremities suggest a more likely diagnosis.

B. Chronic granulomatous disease - This condition is characterized by recurrent infections and the formation of granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that form in response to infection. However, the patient's age and the presence of eczematous lesions on the scalp and extremities suggest a more likely diagnosis.

C. Severe combined immunodeficiency - This condition is characterized by a severe deficiency in the immune system, which can lead to recurrent infections and other immune-related complications. However, the patient's age and the presence of eczematous lesions on the scalp and extremities suggest a more likely diagnosis.

D. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome - This rare genetic disorder is characterized by a deficiency in the immune system, eczematous lesions, and a higher risk of infections. The patient's age and the presence of eczematous lesions on the scalp and extremities suggest a more likely diagnosis.

Answer: D. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome."
485,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: The adrenal gland's inferior aspect receives oxygenated blood from a vessel identified during an autopsy. Which of the following vessels is most likely to have given rise to this vessel?

A. The renal artery is the most likely source of the vessel that supplies oxygenated blood to the inferior aspect of the right adrenal gland.
B. The inferior phrenic artery is a possible source of the vessel, as it supplies blood to the inferior aspect of the diaphragm and may also supply blood to the adrenal gland.
C. The superior mesenteric artery is a possible source of the vessel, as it supplies blood to the small intestine and other structures in the abdominal cavity that may be in close proximity to the adrenal gland.
D. The common iliac artery is a possible source of the vessel, as it supplies blood to the lower abdominal cavity and may also supply blood to the adrenal gland.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
486,"Question: A 25-year-old woman presents with intense vaginal pruritus and pain for the past week. She says the pain is worse when she urinates. Her last menstrual period was 4 weeks ago. She is sexually active, has a single partner, and uses condoms infrequently. She denies any recent history of fevers, chills, abdominal or flank pain, or menstrual irregularities. Her past medical history is significant for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), diagnosed 5 years ago and managed medically. Her current medications include prednisone and oral contraceptives. The patient is afebrile and her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is significant for a small amount of discharge from the vagina, along with severe inflammation and scarring. The discharge is thick, white, and has the consistency of cottage cheese. The vaginal pH is 4.1. The microscopic examination of potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount of the vaginal discharge reveals pseudohyphae. A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following would be the most appropriate treatment for this patient’s condition?

A. Oral fluconazole for the patient alone - This option is the most appropriate treatment for the patient's condition, as the vaginal discharge and pH indicate a yeast infection, which is a common cause of vaginal pruritus and pain. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that can effectively treat yeast infections.

B. Oral fluconazole for the patient and her sexual partner - While this option may seem like a good choice, it is not the most appropriate treatment for the patient's condition. Yeast infections are not typically contagious, and treating the patient's partner may not address the underlying cause of the infection.

C. Oral metronidazole for the patient and her sexual partner - Similar to option B, treating the patient's partner may not address the underlying cause of the infection. Metronidazole is an antibiotic that may be effective against some types of bacterial infections, but it is not effective against yeast infections.

D. A single dose of azithromycin - This option is not the most appropriate treatment for the patient's condition. Azithromycin is an antibiotic that may be effective against some types of bacterial infections, but it is not effective against yeast infections."
487,"Question: An experiment to investigate the impact of gravity on blood pressure is carried out on 3 individuals of equal height and blood pressure who are positioned in different orientations in space. Which of the following positions will have the lowest recorded blood pressure reading?

Options:
A. Participant A: at the level of the head - This option is incorrect because the gravitational force is stronger at the head than at the feet, which means that the blood pressure reading at the head will be higher than at the feet.
B. Participant C: at the level of the heart - This option is also incorrect because the heart is located closer to the center of the body than the feet, and therefore, the gravitational force on the heart is weaker than on the feet, resulting in a higher blood pressure reading at the heart than at the feet.
C. Participant A: at the level of the feet - This is the correct answer. The feet are located farthest from the center of the body and are therefore subjected to the weakest gravitational force, resulting in the lowest blood pressure reading at this location.
D. Participant B: at the level of the head - This option is incorrect because the gravitational force is stronger at the head than at the feet, which means that the blood pressure reading at the head will be higher than at the feet.

Answer: C. Participant A: at the level of the feet."
488,"Question: A 27-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a concern about her pregnancy. This is her first pregnancy, and she is currently at 33 weeks gestation. She states that she has experienced diffuse swelling of her ankles and legs and is concerned that it is abnormal. Otherwise, she has no concerns. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and diabetes. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 147/92 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Physical exam reveals bilateral edema of the lower extremities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

A. A 24-hour urine protein collection to evaluate for pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) or preeclampsia.
B. Echocardiography to evaluate for potential cardiac problems related to diabetes or pregnancy.
C. Reassurance and follow-up in 1 week to monitor the swelling and adjust management accordingly.
D. Spot protein to creatinine ratio to evaluate for proteinuria, a common sign of preeclampsia.

Answer: D. Spot protein to creatinine ratio.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of diffuse swelling of the ankles and legs, particularly in a patient with a history of obesity and diabetes, are concerning for preeclampsia. A spot protein to creatinine ratio can quickly and accurately assess for proteinuria, which is a common sign of preeclampsia. This is the best next step in management to determine the likelihood of preeclampsia and guide further management. The other options are not as relevant or urgent in this scenario."
489,"Question: A 31-year-old male presents to the physician with a 2-day history of blisters and brownish discoloration of urine. His symptoms began after a 4-day trip to Florida with his friends. He has experienced similar episodes of blistering twice in the past three years, each of which resolved spontaneously after a few weeks. On examination, vesicles and bullae are noted on the face and the dorsal surfaces of his hands and forearms. Which enzyme defect is most likely responsible for his condition?

A. Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase
B. Uroporphyrinogen III synthase
C. Uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase
D. Aminolevulinic acid synthase

490,"Question: A 61-year-old woman presents to her physician with a persistent, dull headache and generalized body aches that have lasted for 8 months, along with difficulty hearing from her left side, which started a month after the onset of the headaches. Five months ago, she underwent surgery to repair a fracture of her right femur that occurred without any significant trauma. Five years ago, she underwent a total thyroidectomy for localized thyroid carcinoma. She takes levothyroxine and calcium supplements since menopause. On physical examination, her prominent forehead and irregular, tender skull surface are noted, along with bony tenderness in the bilateral hip and knee joints, and limited range of motion in the right hip joint. Laboratory tests reveal an elevated level of alkaline phosphatase, with normal levels of vitamin D, calcium, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). A head X-ray is likely to show which of the following findings?

A. Lytic lesions with no sclerotic margin
B. Mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions
C. Periosteal trabeculations with radiolucent marrow hyperplasia
D. Generalized dense, sclerotic bone

Answer: B. Mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions."
491,"Sure! Here is the rewritten question in my own style:

The removed gallbladder is sent for histological evaluation. The pathologist examines the slide and identifies several structures numbered in the exhibit. Which of the following statements is correct?

Options:
A. The cells in area 1 are responsible for secreting bile.
B. The cells in area 3 are inactivated by cholecystokinin.
C. This section is taken from a site that does not adjoin the liver.
D. Normally, there should be goblet cells present among the cells in area 1.

Answer: C. This section is taken from a site that does not adjoin the liver."
492,"Question: A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with right knee pain after being tackled during a game of soccer. He experiences severe pain and is unable to stand or walk following the injury. On examination, his right knee is swollen and tender, with external rotation causing a sharp, locking sensation. Which of the following structures is most likely to be injured?

A. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
B. Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)
C. Medial meniscus tear
D. Lateral meniscus tear

Answer: C. Medial meniscus tear.

The patient's symptoms of severe pain, swelling, and local tenderness, particularly on the medial aspect of the knee, are consistent with a medial meniscus tear. The locking sensation elicited by external rotation suggests that the tear may be a bucket handle tear, which is a common type of medial meniscus tear. The ACL and PCL are less likely to be involved in this scenario, as the patient did not report any give-way or instability in the knee."
493,"Question: An 18-month-old boy is brought in by his parents due to failure to gain weight. What is the predominant type of hemoglobin in this patient's blood?

Options:
A. Hemoglobin Bart
B. Hemoglobin F
C. Hemoglobin A2
D. Hemoglobin S

Answer: B. Hemoglobin F

Explanation:

The patient's laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, which is indicative of anemia. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 67 μm3, which is slightly lower than normal. The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is 12.7%, which suggests that the red blood cells are larger than normal. The white blood cell count is normal, and the platelet count is slightly low.

The plain radiograph of the patient's skull shows a prominent bone at the sella turcica, which is a characteristic feature of hemoglobin F anemia. Hemoglobin F is a normal hemoglobin variant that is present in about 10% of the population, but it can cause anemia in some cases. Therefore, the predominant type of hemoglobin in this patient's blood is Hemoglobin F.

Option A, Hemoglobin Bart, is not a recognized type of hemoglobin. Option C, Hemoglobin A2, is a variant that is also present in about 10% of the population but does not typically cause anemia. Option D, Hemoglobin S, is a rare genetic disorder that can cause anemia."
494,"Question: A 65-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. He was working on his car at home when he suddenly experienced this symptom, which did not improve with rest. He inhaled various chemicals and inhalants while attempting to replace a broken engine part. The patient was brought in by paramedics and is currently receiving 100% oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient has a 52 pack-year smoking history and drinks 2-3 alcoholic beverages every night. He has a past medical history of asthma but has not seen a doctor since high school. His temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 157/108 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 29/min, and oxygen saturation is 77%. Physical examination reveals tachycardia with a systolic murmur heard best along the right upper sternal border. Breath sounds are diminished over the right upper lobe. Bilateral lower extremity pitting edema is noted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Fe3+ hemoglobin in circulating red blood cells
B. Pulmonary edema due to decreased cardiac output
C. Rupture of an emphysematous bleb
D. Severe bronchoconstriction

Answer: C. Rupture of an emphysematous bleb

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, tachycardia, and diminished breath sounds over the right upper lobe, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, are consistent with a rupture of an emphysematous bleb. Emphysematous blebs are air-filled sacs that can form in the lungs as a result of chronic inflammation and damage to the lung tissue, often in smokers. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of bilateral lower extremity edema further support this diagnosis. Pulmonary edema due to decreased cardiac output, severe bronchoconstriction, and Fe3+ hemoglobin in circulating red blood cells are less likely given the patient's presentation and medical history."
495,"Question: A 64-year-old man presents to his physician for a scheduled follow-up visit. He has chronic left-sided heart failure with systolic dysfunction. His current regular medications include captopril and digoxin, which were started after his last episode of symptomatic heart failure approximately 3 months ago. His last episode of heart failure was accompanied by atrial fibrillation, which followed an alcohol binge over a weekend. Since then he stopped drinking. He reports that he has no current symptoms at rest and is able to perform regular physical exercise without limitation. On physical examination, mild bipedal edema is noted. The physician suggested to him that he should discontinue digoxin and continue captopril and scheduled him for the next follow-up visit. Which of the following statements best justifies the suggestion made by the physician?

A. Digoxin is useful to treat atrial fibrillation, but does not benefit patients with systolic dysfunction who are in sinus rhythm.

B. Digoxin does not benefit patients with left-sided heart failure in the absence of atrial fibrillation.

C. Captopril is likely to improve the long-term survival of the patient with heart failure, unlike digoxin.

D. Both captopril and digoxin are likely to improve the long-term survival of the patient with heart failure, but digoxin has more severe side effects.

Answer: C. Captopril is likely to improve the long-term survival of the patient with heart failure, unlike digoxin.

Explanation: The physician suggested that the patient should discontinue digoxin and continue captopril, which indicates that the physician believes that captopril is more effective in managing the patient's heart failure than digoxin. This is supported by the fact that captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which has been shown to improve the long-term survival of patients with heart failure by reducing the workload on the heart and improving cardiac function. In contrast, digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that can help control atrial fibrillation, but its benefits in patients with systolic dysfunction are less clear. Therefore, option C is the best answer."
496,"Question: A 48-year-old man presents to the clinic with several weeks of watery diarrhea and right upper quadrant pain with fever. He also endorses malaise, nausea, and anorexia. He is HIV-positive and is currently on antiretroviral therapy. He admits to not being compliant with his current medications. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 100/84 mmHg. A physical examination is performed which is within normal limits. His blood tests results are given below:

Hb%: 11 gm/dL
Total count (WBC): 3,400 /mm3
Differential count:
Neutrophils: 70%
Lymphocytes: 25%
Monocytes: 5%
CD4+ cell count: 88/mm3
Stool microscopy results are pending.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Cryptosporidiosis
B. Irritable bowel syndrome
C. Norovirus infection
D. Traveler’s diarrhea due to ETEC

Answer: A. Cryptosporidiosis

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, right upper quadrant pain, and fever, along with his HIV status and lack of compliance with medication, are all consistent with cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidiosis is a parasitic infection that can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as those with HIV. The patient's low CD4+ cell count and history of non-compliance with medication also increase the likelihood of cryptosporidiosis. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), norovirus infection, and traveler's diarrhea due to ETEC are less likely given the patient's presentation and medical history."
497,"Question: A 38-year-old woman presents with generalized weakness and dizziness for the past 3 weeks. What is the most likely cause of her condition?

Options:

A. Red cell membrane defect
B. IgG-mediated hemolysis
C. IgM-mediated hemolysis
D. Chronic inflammation

Answer: B. IgG-mediated hemolysis

Rationale: The patient's laboratory results, including the positive direct antiglobulin test and the presence of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear, are consistent with IgG-mediated hemolysis. This is a common cause of hemolytic anemia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, as the autoantibodies produced in the condition can target red blood cells and cause their premature destruction. The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus and the presence of icterus on the sclera also support this diagnosis. While red cell membrane defects and chronic inflammation could also potentially contribute to the patient's anemia, IgG-mediated hemolysis is the most likely cause based on the available information."
498,"Question: An 83-year-old male presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. What would you expect to see in the patient's dipstick urinalysis?

Options:
A. Detection of an enzyme produced by red blood cells
B. Direct detection of white blood cell surface proteins
C. Detection of urinary nitrate conversion by gram-negative pathogens
D. Detection of an enzyme produced by gram-negative pathogens

Answer: C. Detection of urinary nitrate conversion by gram-negative pathogens

Explanation: The patient's presentation with altered mental status and the immediate return of cloudy, pink urine after the placement of a foley catheter suggests a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). Dipstick urinalysis can detect the presence of nitrites, which are produced by gram-negative pathogens during the metabolism of nitrogen in the urine. The presence of nitrites in the urine indicates the presence of a UTI caused by gram-negative pathogens."
499,"Question: A 68-year-old man presents for his first hemodialysis treatment. He was diagnosed with progressive chronic kidney disease 6 years ago that has now resulted in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He currently is on a waiting list for a kidney transplant. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and peptic ulcer disease, managed with amlodipine and esomeprazole, respectively. He has diligently followed a severely restricted diet. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are normal. His latest serum creatinine gives him an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 12 mL/min/1.73 m2. Which of the following should be increased as part of the management of this patient?

Options:

A. Sodium intake - Increasing sodium intake would be detrimental to the patient's management, as ESRD patients require a low-sodium diet to help manage fluid overload and hypertension.

B. Potassium intake - Increasing potassium intake would be appropriate for this patient, as ESRD patients often have decreased potassium levels due to impaired kidney function.

C. Protein intake - Increasing protein intake would be beneficial for this patient, as protein is essential for maintaining muscle mass and strength, which can be compromised in ESRD patients.

D. Fiber intake - Increasing fiber intake would not be necessary or beneficial for this patient, as ESRD patients do not require a high-fiber diet.

Answer: C. Protein intake."
500,"Question: A 29-year-old woman with hypothyroidism seeks advice from her primary care physician on selecting a health insurance plan that meets her needs. She is a baker and owns a small bakery, and she wants a plan with affordable monthly premiums. She is willing to pay more to see providers outside her network or get specialist care if referred by her primary care physician. Which of the following insurance plans would be the best fit?

Options:
A. Preferred provider organization (PPO)
B. Medicare
C. Medicaid
D. Point of service (POS)

Answer: D. Point of service (POS)

Explanation: A point of service (POS) plan is the most appropriate choice for this patient because it offers the flexibility she desires. With a POS plan, she can see providers outside her network for an additional fee, allowing her to get specialist care if referred by her primary care physician. Additionally, POS plans typically have lower out-of-pocket costs than other types of plans, which would help reduce her overall healthcare expenses."
501,"Question: A previously healthy 3-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents for the evaluation of recurrent episodes of pain in her left wrist and right knee for 4 months. She has not had any trauma to the knee or any previous problems with her joints. She attends daycare. Her mother has rheumatoid arthritis. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right knee and left wrist shows mild swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema; range of motion is slightly decreased. No other joints are affected. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:

Hemoglobin 12.4 g/dL
Leukocyte count 9,000/mm3
Platelet count 200,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 50 mm/h
Serum
Antinuclear antibodies 1:320
Rheumatoid factor negative

This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?

A. Airway obstruction
B. Inflammation of sacroiliac joints
C. Coronary artery aneurysm
D. Blindness

Answer: D. Blindness

The patient's family history of rheumatoid arthritis, combined with the presence of antinuclear antibodies in the blood, suggests that the patient may be at risk for developing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a autoimmune disorder that can affect multiple organs and systems, including the eyes, leading to blindness. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
502,"Question: A group of scientists studying the properties of muscle cells in vitro decide to conduct an experiment to observe their distinguishing properties. 3 types of muscle cells isolated from human tissues are labeled as X, Y, and Z and placed in physiological solutions alongside controls X’, Y’ and Z’. Antibodies against the sarcoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase are added to the solutions containing the experimental group and their cytosolic calcium concentration is compared with their corresponding controls 5 minutes after depolarization. Muscle type X is seen to have the highest cytosolic calcium concentration among the experimental and control groups 5 minutes after depolarization. Muscle types Y and Z, on the other hand, are both observed to have lower, equal cytosolic calcium concentrations but higher than their corresponding controls. To distinguish between the 2 cell types, the scientists tag both cells with a compound capable of fluorescing titin and observes a luminescent pattern in muscle type Y under microscopy. Which of the following set of muscle cell types best describes X, Y, and Z respectively?

A. Skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, cardiac muscle

Skeletal muscle is characterized by its ability to contract voluntarily, making it the best option for X. Cardiac muscle, on the other hand, is involuntary and beats automatically, which makes it a better fit for Z. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of hollow organs and is characterized by its ability to contract and relax in response to changes in the internal environment, which makes it a good option for Y. Therefore, the best set of muscle cell types to describe X, Y, and Z is:

C. Skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle."
503,"Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician by his mother for a routine medical examination. His medical history is relevant for delayed gross motor milestones. The mother is concerned about a growth delay because both of his brothers were twice his size at this age. Physical examination reveals a well-groomed and healthy boy with a prominent forehead and short stature, in addition to shortened upper and lower extremities with a normal vertebral column. The patient’s vitals reveal: temperature 36.5°C (97.6°F); pulse 60/min; and respiratory rate 17/min and a normal intelligence quotient (IQ). A mutation in which of the following genes is the most likely cause underlying the patient's condition?

A. Alpha-1 type I collagen
B. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3
C. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor
D. Runt-related transcription factor 2

Answer: B. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3

The patient's short stature and shortened upper and lower extremities are consistent with a growth hormone deficiency, which can be caused by mutations in genes that regulate growth and development. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) is a key regulator of growth and development, and mutations in this gene have been identified as a common cause of growth hormone deficiency and short stature. The patient's normal intelligence quotient (IQ) and normal vitals suggest that the growth delay is not due to a cognitive or metabolic disorder, further supporting the likelihood of a genetic cause. While Alpha-1 type I collagen, Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, and Runt-related transcription factor 2 are also important genes involved in growth and development, mutations in these genes are less likely to cause growth hormone deficiency in this patient's case."
504,"Question: A 73-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Her daughter who accompanies her says she was in her usual state of health until two days ago when she started to complain of abdominal pain and was unable to tolerate oral intake. She has hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and osteoarthritis. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy for an ovarian mass a year ago where a mucinous cystadenoma was excised. Her medications include aspirin, nifedipine, lisinopril, metoprolol, warfarin, and Tylenol as needed for pain. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. She appears ill and disoriented. Her temperature is 37.9°C (100.3°F), blood pressure is 102/60 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min and irregular, and respirations are 16/min. Examination shows diffuse tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. The abdomen is tympanitic on percussion. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There is a soft crescendo-decrescendo murmur best auscultated in the right second intercostal space. Laboratory studies show:

Hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL
Leukocyte count 14,000/mm3
Platelet count 130,000/mm3
Prothrombin time 38 seconds
INR 3.2
Serum
Na+ 132 mEq/dL
K+ 3.6 mEq/dL
Cl- 102 mEq/dL
HCO3- 19 mEq/dL
Urea nitrogen 36 mg/dl
Creatinine 2.3 mg/dL
Lactate 2.8 mEq/dL (N= 0.5-2.2 mEq/dL)

An x-ray of the abdomen shows multiple centrally located dilated loops of gas-filled bowel. There is no free air under the diaphragm. A nasogastric tube is inserted, and IV fluids and empiric antibiotic therapy are started. Emergent exploratory laparotomy is planned. Which of the following is the next best step in management?

A. Administer protamine sulfate
B. Administer fresh frozen plasma and Vitamin K
C. Administer platelet concentrate
D. Administer recombinant activated factor VII

Answer: B. Administer fresh frozen plasma and Vitamin K

Rationale: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) suggest that she has a coagulopathy, likely due to vitamin K deficiency. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is a rich source of vitamin K and can help to correct the coagulopathy. Vitamin K is also important in the treatment of bleeding disorders. Administering FFP and vitamin K is the next best step in management to correct the coagulopathy and prevent further bleeding. Protamine sulfate, platelet concentrate, and recombinant activated factor VII are not appropriate interventions for this patient's presentation."
505,"Question: A 5-year-old boy presents to his pediatrician with weakness. His father observed that his son seemed less energetic at daycare and kindergarten classes. He was becoming easily fatigued from mild play. His temperature is 98°F (37°C), blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical exam reveals pale conjunctiva, poor skin turgor and capillary refill, and cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy with assorted bruises throughout his body. A complete blood count reveals the following:

Leukocyte count: 3,000/mm^3
Segmented neutrophils: 30%
Bands: 5%
Eosinophils: 5%
Basophils: 10%
Lymphocytes: 40%
Monocytes: 10%

Hemoglobin: 7.1 g/dL
Hematocrit: 22%
Platelet count: 50,000/mm^3

The most specific diagnostic assessment would most likely show which of the following?

A. Bone marrow biopsy with > 25% lymphoblasts
B. Flow cytometry with positive terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase staining
C. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with 9:22 translocation
D. Peripheral blood smear with > 50% lymphoblasts

Answer: A. Bone marrow biopsy with > 25% lymphoblasts.

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possibility of leukemia, specifically acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A bone marrow biopsy would be the most specific diagnostic assessment to confirm the diagnosis, as it would allow for the evaluation of the marrow aspirate for the presence of > 25% lymphoblasts, which is a hallmark of ALL. Flow cytometry, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, and peripheral blood smear are also useful tools in the diagnosis of leukemia, but they may not be as specific as a bone marrow biopsy in detecting the presence of lymphoblasts."
506,"Question: A 58-year-old woman with New York Heart Association Class III heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and bipolar disorder presents to the urgent care center with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, double vision, and describes seeing green/yellow outlines around objects. Which medication is most likely responsible for her symptoms?

Options:
A. Digoxin: Given the patient's history of heart failure and atrial fibrillation, digoxin is a reasonable option to consider as a potential cause of her symptoms. Digoxin can cause visual disturbances, including halos and blurred vision, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.

B. Amiodarone: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication that can cause a range of side effects, including visual disturbances such as blurred vision, double vision, and halos. It can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and vomiting.

C. Lithium: Lithium is a mood stabilizer that can cause visual disturbances such as blurred vision, double vision, and halos. It can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and vomiting.

D. Bisoprolol: Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and vomiting, but it is less likely to cause visual disturbances compared to the other options.

Answer: A. Digoxin."
507,"Question: A 72-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with a productive cough and fever. A chest radiograph shows a lobar consolidation, and he is diagnosed with pneumonia. He has a history of a penicillin and cephalosporin allergy. The attending physician orders IV levofloxacin as empiric therapy. On morning rounds the next day, the team discovers that the patient was administered ceftriaxone instead of levofloxacin. The patient has already received a full dose of ceftriaxone and has developed hives overnight, which were treated with diphenhydramine. He is currently feeling better. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Continue with ceftriaxone and use diphenhydramine as needed - This option is incorrect because ceftriaxone is a cephalosporin, which is the same class of antibiotic that the patient is allergic to. Continuing to administer ceftriaxone could potentially cause a severe allergic reaction or other adverse effects.

B. Desensitize the patient to ceftriaxone and continue treatment - This option is also incorrect because desensitization is a complex and time-consuming process that requires careful monitoring and close observation. It is not a feasible option in this situation, especially given the patient's history of severe allergic reactions.

C. Discuss the error that occurred with the patient - This option is the most appropriate next step in management. The error in medication administration is significant, and it is important to address it with the patient and the healthcare team to prevent similar errors in the future. The patient should be informed of the error, and the team should discuss strategies to prevent it from happening again, such as double-checking medications before administration and using barcode scanning to verify medications.

D. Inform the patient that nursing gave the wrong medication and it has been corrected - This option is incorrect because the patient has already received a full dose of ceftriaxone, which is the wrong medication. Informing the patient that nursing gave the wrong medication may cause confusion and alarm, and it is not a sufficient explanation for the error."
508,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 32-year-old woman is rushed to the emergency department after sustaining burns from a bonfire. She's in moderate distress and has severe pain in her left leg and torso, with minimal pain in her right arm. She doesn't smoke and takes no medications. Her vital signs are normal, except for a temperature of 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse rate of 88/min, respiratory rate of 19/min, and blood pressure of 118/65 mm Hg. A pulse oximetry reading of 98% is obtained on room air. Cardiopulmonary examination reveals no abnormalities. There are two tender, blanchable erythemas without blisters over a 5 x 6 cm area of the left abdomen and a 3 x 2 cm area of the left anterior thigh. Additionally, there's an area of white, leathery skin and tissue necrosis surrounding the right upper extremity just proximal to the elbow, which is dry and nontender. An ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with no ST or T wave changes. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A. Serial arterial blood gas analysis to assess the patient's respiratory and metabolic status.
B. Soft-tissue ultrasound to evaluate the extent and depth of the burns.
C. Intravenous ampicillin therapy to cover potential bacterial infections.
D. Monitoring of peripheral pulses and capillary filling to assess for any signs of circulatory instability.

Answer: D. Monitoring of peripheral pulses and capillary filling.

Rationale: The patient has sustained significant burns, and it is crucial to monitor her circulatory status to ensure that she doesn't develop any complications, such as hypovolemia or hypotension. Monitoring peripheral pulses and capillary filling can help identify any changes in the patient's circulation and allow for prompt interventions if necessary. While serial arterial blood gas analysis can provide valuable information about the patient's respiratory and metabolic status, it may not be as immediately useful in this situation as monitoring peripheral pulses and capillary filling. Soft-tissue ultrasound can help evaluate the extent and depth of the burns, but it may not be necessary in the immediate management of the patient. Intravenous ampicillin therapy may be considered if there are signs of bacterial infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management at this time."
509,"Question: A 43-year-old male with a history of thyroid cancer status post total thyroidectomy presents to his primary care physician after repeated bouts of headaches. His headaches are preceded by periods of anxiety, palpitations, and sweating. The patient says he is unable to pinpoint any precipitating factors and instead says the events occur without warning. Of note, the patient's father and uncle also have a history of thyroid cancer. On exam his vitals are: T 36.8 HR 87, BP 135/93, RR 14, and O2 Sat 100% on room air. The patient's TSH is within normal limits, and he reports taking his levothyroxine as prescribed. What is the next best step in diagnosing this patient's chief complaint?

A. Abdominal CT scan with and without IV contrast: While a CT scan can help identify any underlying structural abnormalities in the head or neck, it may not be the most relevant diagnostic test for this patient's symptoms. The patient's symptoms of headaches, anxiety, palpitations, and sweating are more consistent with a pituitary or adrenal disorder, which a CT scan may not be able to detect.

B. 24-hour urine free cortisol: This test can help evaluate the patient's adrenal function and identify any abnormalities in cortisol production. However, as the patient's symptoms are not specifically related to cortisol dysfunction, this test may not be the most useful in diagnosing the patient's chief complaint.

C. High dose dexamethasone suppression test: This test can help evaluate the patient's adrenal function and identify any abnormalities in cortisol production. The test involves administering a high dose of dexamethasone and measuring the patient's cortisol levels over a 24-hour period. If the patient's cortisol levels remain elevated after the dexamethasone dose, it may indicate an adrenal insufficiency or hyperfunction, which could be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

D. Plasma fractionated metanephrines: This test can help evaluate the patient's pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, which are rare tumors that can produce catecholamines and cause symptoms similar to those described by the patient. The test involves measuring the patient's plasma levels of metanephrines, which are the major catecholamines produced by the adrenal glands. If the patient's metanephrine levels are elevated, it may indicate the presence of a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.

Answer: D. Plasma fractionated metanephrines."
510,"Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. The boy was born at term via vaginal delivery and has been healthy except for impaired vision due to severe short-sightedness. He is at the 97th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Oral examination shows a high-arched palate. He has abnormally long, slender fingers and toes, and his finger joints are hyperflexible. The patient is asked to place his thumbs in the palms of the same hand and then clench to form a fist. The thumbs are noted to protrude beyond the ulnar border of the hand. Slit lamp examination shows lens subluxation in the superotemporal direction bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?

A. Mutation in fibrillin-1 gene
B. Defective collagen cross-linking
C. Nondisjunction of sex chromosomes
D. Mutation in RET gene

Answer: A. Mutation in fibrillin-1 gene

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including the high-arched palate, abnormally long and slender fingers and toes, and hyperflexible finger joints, are consistent with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. The patient's lens subluxation in the superotemporal direction bilaterally is also consistent with Marfan syndrome, which can affect the eye and cause lens dislocation. Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, including the skin, bones, and eyes. The other options are less likely causes of the patient's condition based on the symptoms and findings presented."
511,"Question: A 70-year-old man presents to the physician with difficulty swallowing for 6 months, followed by occasional coughing up of undigested food. He has no weight loss or fever, but had a recent episode of sore throat that resolved on its own. He has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years and currently takes alendronate and omeprazole. On examination, he has foul-smelling breath and a fluctuant mass on the right neck. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the patient's symptoms?

A. Deep neck space infection
B. Degeneration of neurons in the esophageal wall
C. Cellular dysplasia
D. Abnormal esophageal motor function

Answer: D. Abnormal esophageal motor function

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing and coughing up undigested food are consistent with dysfunction in the esophageal muscles and their ability to properly propel food through the digestive tract. The patient's history of smoking and age also increase the likelihood of abnormal esophageal motor function. While deep neck space infection, degeneration of neurons in the esophageal wall, and cellular dysplasia are all possible causes of esophageal symptoms, they are less likely to be the primary cause in this case."
512,"Question: A 9-year-old girl is brought to the pediatrician for a wellness checkup. The girl's past medical history is non-contributory, and she has met all her developmental milestones. Her parents were recently called into the office as the girl was found touching the genitals of one of her classmates. She was trying to insert a toy into her classmate's genitals. The girl is asked what has happened and what she thinks is going on but she is too shy to reply to the physician. The girl and her mother recently moved in with a family member. They live in low-income housing subsidized by the government and are currently on food stamps. The mother states that her daughter has been particularly argumentative lately and that they have gotten into arguments in which her daughter screamed at her and locked herself in the bathroom. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Adjustment disorder: This diagnosis is less likely as the girl's behavior is not solely related to a stressful event, such as a move or financial difficulties. While the girl's behavior may be affected by these factors, it is more likely that there is an underlying psychological issue that is causing her argumentativeness and aggressive behavior.

B. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): This diagnosis is also less likely as the girl's behavior is not primarily characterized by inattention or hyperactivity. While the girl may be argumentative and aggressive, it is not typical of ADHD.

C. Precocious puberty: This diagnosis is unlikely as the girl is only 9 years old and has not shown any signs of early puberty.

D. Sexual abuse: This diagnosis is the most likely given the girl's behavior. The girl's attempt to insert a toy into her classmate's genitals is a concerning sign of sexualized behavior, which could be indicative of sexual abuse. The girl's shyness and argumentativeness could also be a result of the trauma of sexual abuse. It is important for the physician to investigate this possibility and take appropriate steps to ensure the girl's safety."
513,"Question: A 51-year-old woman presents to your office with 2 weeks of fatigue and generalized weakness. She has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was recently diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and started on disease-modifying therapy. She states she has felt less able to do things she enjoys and feels guilty she can't play sports with her children. Review of systems is notable for the patient occasionally seeing a small amount of bright red blood on the toilet paper. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.

Hemoglobin: 12 g/dL
Hematocrit: 36%
Leukocyte count: 7,700/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 207,000/mm^3
MCV: 110 fL

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's fatigue?

A. Depression
B. Iron deficiency
C. Medication side effect
D. Vitamin B12 deficiency

Answer: C. Medication side effect

Rationale: The patient's fatigue and weakness are likely related to the side effects of the disease-modifying therapy (DMT) she has been prescribed for her rheumatoid arthritis. DMTs can cause a range of side effects, including fatigue, weakness, and malaise, which can be severe and persistent. The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes also increase the likelihood that the fatigue is related to medication side effects. Iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms, given her normal hematocrit and MCV levels. Depression is also less likely, given the patient's recent diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and the fact that she is experiencing guilt about not being able to play sports with her children, which is more consistent with a medication side effect."
514,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: An elderly woman visits her primary care physician for a routine check-up, complaining of persistent fatigue and difficulty completing her daily household tasks. She also experiences shortness of breath with mild exertion. Her medical history includes diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and primary biliary cirrhosis. She takes lisinopril, insulin, and metformin. She drinks one beer daily.

515,"Question: A 37-year-old woman seeks consultation for various contraception options. She has a medical history of hypertension, Wilson's disease, and constipation-dominant irritable bowel syndrome. She takes rivaroxaban and polyethylene glycol. Her blood pressure is 152/98 mmHg, and on physical examination, she appears alert and oriented. The heart auscultation reveals a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezing. The first day of her last menstrual period was 12 days ago, and the urine hCG is negative. Given her history and physical examination, which of the following contraception options is the most suitable?

A. Levonorgestrel: Levonorgestrel is a popular emergency contraception option that can be used to prevent pregnancy up to 72 hours after unprotected sex. Given the patient's history of hypertension, it is crucial to note that levonorgestrel may not be the best option due to the potential risk of blood pressure fluctuations. However, since the patient is already taking rivaroxaban, the risk may be minimal.

B. Ethinyl estradiol: Ethinyl estradiol is a commonly used hormonal contraceptive that can be administered orally or through a patch. It is an effective method of preventing pregnancy but may not be suitable for patients with a history of blood clotting disorders like Wilson's disease.

C. Copper IUD: A copper IUD is a long-acting reversible contraceptive that can be inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy for up to 10 years. It is a safe and effective option for patients with a history of hypertension, as it does not contain any hormones that could exacerbate the condition.

D. Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate: Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate is a long-acting injectable contraceptive that can be administered every 3 months. It is a viable option for patients who prefer a hormonal method of contraception but may not be suitable for those with a history of blood clotting disorders like Wilson's disease.

Answer: A. Levonorgestrel"
516,"Question: A 1-month-old female presents to the pediatrician for a well visit. Her mother reports that the patient has been exclusively breastfed since birth, and exhibits frequent crying, particularly in the evening. The patient's crying is persistent and difficult to console, lasting up to 20-30 minutes at a time. The patient's height and weight are within the 60th and 70th percentiles, respectively, and her physical exam is unremarkable.

Options:
A. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): GERD is a condition in which stomach acid flows back up into the esophagus, causing discomfort and difficulty feeding. While GERD can cause crying and irritability in infants, it is unlikely to be the primary cause of the patient's persistent crying in this case, as the mother reports that the patient is feeding well and gaining weight appropriately.

B. Infantile colic: Infantile colic is a common condition characterized by excessive crying in infants, typically in the late afternoon or evening. The exact cause of colic is unknown, but it is thought to be related to digestive issues or gas. The patient's persistent crying in the evening and difficulty consoling her suggest that infantile colic may be a possibility.

C. Milk protein allergy: A milk protein allergy can cause digestive issues and discomfort in infants, leading to crying and irritability. However, the mother reports that the patient has been exclusively breastfed since birth and has not shown any signs of an allergy to breast milk.

D. Normal infant crying: While it is normal for infants to cry, especially in the first few months of life, the patient's persistent and difficult-to-console crying suggest that there may be an underlying cause. It is possible that the patient is experiencing a temporary bout of colic or has a different underlying condition that needs to be evaluated.

Answer: D. Normal infant crying. The patient's crying is persistent and difficult to console, but it is within the normal range of crying for an infant of this age. Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's crying."
517,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question:
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department in a confused and agitated state, with a sudden onset of symptoms 3 days ago. He has a history of depression, hypertension, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease, and has recently started taking selegiline for worsening Parkinson symptoms. He also takes fluoxetine, lisinopril, insulin, metformin, and oxycodone for pain and anxiety. However, he ran out of these medications last night. His vital signs reveal a temperature of 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure of 111/78 mmHg, pulse of 117/min, respirations of 22/min, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Physical examination shows an irritable, sweaty, and confused elderly man with hyperreflexia of the lower extremities and clonus. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms?

Options:
A. Bacterial infection
B. Electrolyte abnormality
C. Medication complication
D. Viral infection

Answer: C. Medication complication.

The patient's sudden onset of confusion, agitation, and hyperreflexia are consistent with a medication complication, particularly given the recent addition of selegiline to his medication regimen. The patient's history of depression, hypertension, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease also increase the likelihood of a medication-related cause for his symptoms. Bacterial infection, electrolyte abnormality, and viral infection are less likely causes based on the patient's symptoms and medical history."
518,"Question: A 26-year-old female medical student has sustained a needlestick injury while drawing blood from an HIV-positive patient. What is the best next step to manage her exposure?

Options:
A. Perform genotype testing on the source patient and initiate antiretroviral therapy tailored to the results.
B. Draw her repeat HIV serology and initiate three-drug antiretroviral therapy if negative.
C. Draw her repeat HIV serology and initiate three-drug antiretroviral therapy if positive.
D. Draw her repeat HIV serology and immediately initiate three-drug antiretroviral therapy.

Answer: D. Draw her repeat HIV serology and immediately initiate three-drug antiretroviral therapy.

Rationale: The medical student has a negative HIV serology from the beginning of medical school two years ago, and she is monogamous with one male partner and denies any intravenous drug use. However, given the source patient's recent diagnosis of HIV, high viral load, and recent initiation of HAART, it is crucial to immediately initiate antiretroviral therapy to minimize the risk of HIV infection. Performing genotype testing on the source patient may provide additional information on the virus's resistance profile, but it is not a necessary step at this time. Drawing her repeat HIV serology may provide additional information on her current HIV status, but it is not sufficient to manage her exposure in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Initiating three-drug antiretroviral therapy immediately is the best course of action to reduce the risk of HIV infection."
519,"Question: A 27-year-old man with an unknown past medical history is brought to the emergency department acutely intoxicated. The patient was found passed out in a park covered in vomit and urine. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 107/68 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, respiratory rate is 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam is notable for wheezing in all lung fields without any crackles. The patient is started on 2L/min nasal cannula oxygen and IV fluids. His laboratory values are notable for an AST of 200 U/L and an ALT of 100 U/L. An initial chest radiograph is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's pulmonary symptoms?

A. Aspiration event: The patient's wheezing in all lung fields without any crackles suggests that he may have inhaled an irritant or foreign body, leading to inflammation and airway obstruction. Aspiration of food, liquids, or other substances into the lungs can cause wheezing and respiratory distress.

B. Bacterial infection: The patient's elevated AST and ALT levels suggest that there may be some liver injury, which could be caused by a bacterial infection such as pneumonia. Pneumonia is a common bacterial infection that can cause inflammation and damage to the lungs, leading to wheezing and respiratory distress.

C. Elastic tissue destruction: The patient's wheezing in all lung fields without any crackles suggests that there may be damage to the elastic tissue in the lungs, which can cause the airways to become inflamed and obstructed. This can be caused by various factors such as exposure to pollutants, smoking, or other environmental toxins.

D. Environmental antigen: The patient's symptoms of wheezing and respiratory distress could be caused by exposure to an environmental antigen such as pollen, dust, or other airborne pollutants. This can trigger an allergic reaction in the lungs, leading to inflammation and obstruction of the airways.

Answer: D. Environmental antigen."
520,"Question: A 72-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with dyspnea for 2 days. She is on regular hemodialysis at 3 sessions a week but missed her last session due to an unexpected trip. She has a history of congestive heart failure. After urgent hemodialysis, the patient’s dyspnea does not improve as expected. The cardiologist is consulted. After evaluation of the patient, he notes in the patient’s electronic record: “the patient does not have a chronic heart condition and a cardiac cause of dyspnea is unlikely.” The following morning, the nurse finds the cardiologist’s notes about the patient not having congestive heart failure odd. The patient had a clear history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%. After further investigation, the nurse realizes that the cardiologist evaluated the patient’s roommate. She is an elderly woman with a similar first name. She is also on chronic hemodialysis. To prevent similar future errors, the most appropriate strategy is to use which of the following?

A. A patient’s medical identification number at every encounter by any healthcare provider: Using a patient's medical identification number at every encounter by any healthcare provider can help ensure that the correct patient is being evaluated and treated. However, this option is not the best choice in this scenario as the cardiologist evaluated the patient's roommate, not the patient, and the nurse realized this mistake only after further investigation.

B. A patient’s medical identification number at every physician-patient encounter: This option is also not the best choice as it does not address the issue of the cardiologist evaluating the wrong patient.

C. Two patient identifiers at every nurse-patient encounter: Requiring two patient identifiers at every nurse-patient encounter can help ensure that the correct patient is being treated, but it may not prevent errors in other situations, such as when other healthcare providers are involved.

D. Two patient identifiers at every patient encounter by any healthcare provider: Requiring two patient identifiers at every patient encounter by any healthcare provider can help ensure that the correct patient is being treated and prevent similar errors in the future. This is the best answer choice as it addresses the root cause of the problem and can help prevent similar errors from occurring in the future."
521,"Question: A 27-year-old male presents to clinic complaining of coughing up small amounts of blood daily for the past week. He denies smoking, sick contacts, or recent travel. Chest radiographs demonstrate interstitial pneumonia with patchy alveolar infiltrates suggestive of multiple bleeding sites. Urinalysis is positive for blood and protein. A positive result is returned for anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM Ab). What is the most likely diagnosis?

Question:

Options:
A. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
B. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegner's)
C. Churg-Strauss syndrome
D. Goodpasture disease

Answer: D. Goodpasture disease

Explanation:
Goodpasture disease is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the deposition of anti-GBM antibodies in the glomeruli, leading to hematuria and nephritis. The presence of interstitial pneumonia with patchy alveolar infiltrates, along with the positive result for anti-GBM Ab, strongly suggests the diagnosis of Goodpasture disease. While SLE, Wegner's granulomatosis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome can also present with hematuria and nephritis, the presence of interstitial pneumonia and the positive anti-GBM Ab result are more consistent with Goodpasture disease."
522,"Question: An elderly man is brought to the emergency department with severe left ear pain and discharge for 3 days. He has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. He appears uncomfortable. Physical examination of the ear shows marked periauricular erythema, exquisite tenderness on palpation, and granulation tissue in the external auditory canal. What pathogen is most likely to cause this condition, given its exotoxin mechanism similar to that of?

Options:
A. Corynebacterium diphtheriae: This bacterium produces a potent exotoxin that can cause severe inflammation and tissue damage in the ear, leading to the symptoms observed.
B. Bordetella pertussis: While Bordetella pertussis can cause otitis media, its exotoxin mechanism is different from that of Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
C. Shigella dysenteriae: Shigella dysenteriae does not produce an exotoxin and is not likely to cause the observed symptoms.
D. Bacillus anthracis: Bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause anthrax, but it does not produce an exotoxin similar to that of Corynebacterium diphtheriae.

Answer: A. Corynebacterium diphtheriae."
523,"Question: A 53-year-old man is brought to the emergency department following an episode of loss of consciousness 1 hour ago. He had just finished micturating when he fell down. His wife heard the noise and found him unconscious on the floor. He regained consciousness after 30 seconds and was able to talk normally with his wife immediately. There was no urinary incontinence. On arrival, he is alert and oriented. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum concentrations of glucose, creatinine, and electrolytes are within the reference range. An electrocardiogram shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Situational syncope

Situational syncope is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient experienced a sudden loss of consciousness following an episode of micturition, which is a common trigger for situational syncope. The patient's rapid recovery of consciousness and the absence of any focal neurological findings also support this diagnosis. Emotional syncope, neurocardiogenic syncope, and arrhythmogenic syncope are less likely in this case, as there are no signs of any underlying emotional or neurological disorders, and the patient's electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities."
524,"Question: A 76-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter for evaluation of progressive cognitive decline and a 1-year history of incontinence. She was diagnosed with dementia, Alzheimer type, 5 years ago. The daughter has noticed that in the past 2 years, her mother has had increasing word-finding difficulties and forgetfulness. She was previously independent but now lives with her daughter and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. Over the past year, she has had decreased appetite, poor oral intake, and sometimes regurgitates her food. During this time, she has had a 12-kg (26-lb) weight loss. She was treated twice for aspiration pneumonia and now her diet mainly consists of pureed food. She has no advance directives and her daughter says that when her mother was independent the patient mentioned that she would not want any resuscitation or life-sustaining measures if the need arose. The daughter wants to continue taking care of her mother but is concerned about her ability to do so. The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include amlodipine and atorvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. She appears malnourished but is well-groomed. The patient is oriented to self and recognizes her daughter by name, but she is unaware of the place or year. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 17/30. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, urea nitrogen, TSH, and vitamin B12 levels are within the reference range. Her serum albumin is 3 g/dL. Urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

B. Home hospice care

Explanation:

Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, it is clear that she has significant cognitive decline and is no longer able to live independently. She requires assistance with all activities of daily living and has a poor appetite, leading to weight loss and malnutrition. The patient has also had two episodes of aspiration pneumonia, which highlights the risk of complications associated with her swallowing difficulties. Given her wishes and the complexity of her care, home hospice care is the most appropriate next step in management. Home hospice care can provide the patient with comfort care and support, as well as address the practical and emotional needs of the daughter and other family members. This will allow the patient to remain in the comfort of her own home, surrounded by her loved ones, and receive the care and support she needs in the final stages of her life."
525,"Question: A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of weakness and fatigue for 2 days, along with darker than usual urine. She has also been experiencing a persistent non-productive cough and low-grade fever for the past week, and has seasonal allergies. Her vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated temperature. Physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor and scleral icterus, and cardiopulmonary examination shows bibasilar crackles. Laboratory tests show leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral patchy infiltrates. A peripheral blood smear shows spherocytes. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?

A. Osmotic fragility test
B. Direct Coombs test
C. ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor profile
D. Flow cytometry

Answer: B. Direct Coombs test

The Direct Coombs test is the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in this patient. The presence of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear, along with the elevated liver enzymes and bilateral patchy infiltrates on the chest x-ray, are all consistent with hemolytic anemia. The Direct Coombs test can help confirm the presence of antibodies against the patient's own red blood cells, which is a hallmark of hemolytic anemia. The other options are not as relevant to this patient's presentation. Osmotic fragility testing is not typically used to diagnose hemolytic anemia, as it is more commonly used to evaluate red blood cell membrane disorders. ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor profile are not useful in this patient's workup, as they are more relevant to the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Flow cytometry may be used to evaluate red blood cell membrane abnormalities, but it is not necessary in this case."
526,"Question: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother due to a 1-month history of pain in his right leg. The mother has been giving him ketorolac at night to improve his sleep, but the pain has not subsided. Upon physical examination, there is marked tenderness along the right mid-femur. An X-ray of the right lower extremity reveals several lytic lesions in the diaphysis of the femur, surrounded by several layers of new bone. A biopsy of the right femur shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Ewing sarcoma: This is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results. Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that typically affects the long bones of the body, including the femur. The presence of multiple lytic lesions in the diaphysis of the femur, surrounded by new bone formation, is highly consistent with this diagnosis.

B. Chondroblastoma: This rare benign bone tumor typically affects the cartilaginous parts of bones, particularly the ends of long bones. While chondroblastoma can occur in the diaphysis of the femur, it is less likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms based on the imaging findings.

C. Osteochondroma: This benign bone tumor typically affects the cartilaginous parts of bones, particularly the ends of long bones. While osteochondroma can occur in the diaphysis of the femur, it is less likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms based on the imaging findings.

D. Osteoid osteoma: This rare benign bone tumor is characterized by the formation of new bone tissue, which can cause pain and tenderness in the affected area. However, osteoid osteoma typically occurs in the metaphysis of the long bones, rather than the diaphysis.

Answer: A. Ewing sarcoma"
527,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 54-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 3-week history of abdominal distension and generalized abdominal discomfort, including nausea and decreased appetite. He was previously discharged from the hospital 3 months ago after an inguinal hernia repair with no reported complications. He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and untreated hepatitis C. His current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and metformin. His father has a history of alcoholic liver disease. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit 5 years ago and drinks 3-4 beers daily. On examination, he appears cachectic and has a distended abdomen with shifting dullness, but no abdominal tenderness or palpable masses. There is a well-healed surgical scar in the right lower quadrant, and examination of the heart and lungs shows no abnormalities. He has 1+ bilateral lower extremity nonpitting edema. Peritoneal fluid analysis shows cloudy fluid with a cell count of 550/mm3 with lymphocytic predominance, total protein of 3.5 g/dL, albumin of 2.6 g/dL, glucose of 60 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 360 mg/dL. The peritoneal fluid Gram stain is negative, and culture and cytology results are pending. Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, which of the following conditions is the most likely cause of his abdominal distension and generalized abdominal discomfort?

B. Lymphoma

The answer is B. Lymphoma, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune system. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption may have contributed to the development of lymphoma."
528,"Question: A 50-year-old man visits the clinic for a routine health check-up, with maintaining his weight as his primary focus to improve his overall health. The doctor discusses his weight loss goals and the numerous health benefits that come with it, such as better blood pressure management and decreased insulin resistance. The average weight for males aged 50-59 years old in the country is 90 kg (200 lb) with a standard deviation of 27 kg (60 lb). What would be the most likely expected weight if his weight was 2 standard deviations above the mean?

A. 63 kg (140 lb)
B. 145 kg (320 lb) - The most likely expected weight if his weight was 2 standard deviations above the mean would be 145 kg (320 lb), as this is the highest weight within the given range.

C. 118 kg (260 lb)
D. 172 kg (380 lb)

Answer: B. 145 kg (320 lb)"
529,"Question: A 63-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her husband for the evaluation of progressive memory loss for the past 5 months. During the last 2 weeks, she has also had problems getting dressed and finding her way back home from the grocery store. She has had several episodes of jerky, repetitive, twitching movements that resolved spontaneously. She used to work as a teacher but quit her job due to her memory loss. The patient has hypertension. There is no family history of serious illness. Her only medication is hydrochlorothiazide. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 125/80 mmHg. She is oriented only to person and place. She follows commands and speaks fluently, but sometimes cannot recall objects. She is unable to read and seems to have difficulty recognizing objects. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact. Examination shows full muscle strength. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Babinski sign is absent. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is normal. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?

A. Mutant prion accumulation:
The patient's symptoms of progressive memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with coordination and balance are consistent with the effects of mutant prion accumulation. Prions are abnormal proteins that can cause degeneration of brain tissue and lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The patient's history of jerky, repetitive movements and her inability to read and recognize objects also support this diagnosis.

B. Severe cerebral ischemia:
While the patient's symptoms could also be caused by severe cerebral ischemia, there is no mention of any recent history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks. Additionally, the patient's neurological examination findings do not suggest any significant cognitive or motor impairment.

C. Substantia nigra degeneration:
Substantia nigra degeneration is a neurodegenerative disorder that can cause Parkinson's disease. However, the patient's symptoms of progressive memory loss and confusion are not typical of Parkinson's disease.

D. Decreased CSF absorption:
Decreased CSF absorption can cause hydrocephalus, which can lead to symptoms such as progressive memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with coordination and balance. However, the patient's neurological examination findings do not suggest any significant cognitive or motor impairment, and there is no mention of any history of hydrocephalus.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms is mutant prion accumulation."
530,"Question: A 55-year-old woman presents with daytime somnolence. Her BMI is 32 kg/m3 and her husband reports frequent snoring during the night. Polysomnography reveals more than 5 obstructive events per hour. Which of the following conditions does the patient have a higher likelihood of developing?

Options:
A. Pulmonary hypertension - The patient's excessive snoring and sleep disruption could be indicative of obstructive sleep apnea, a condition that can lead to pulmonary hypertension.
B. Emphysema - The patient's obesity and frequent snoring may increase her risk of developing emphysema, a condition characterized by the destruction of the air sacs in the lungs.
C. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - The patient's symptoms of daytime somnolence and snoring may be indicative of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a condition where the lungs become scarred and stiff, leading to breathing difficulties.
D. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis - The patient's exposure to irritants such as smoke or dust may increase her risk of developing hypersensitivity pneumonitis, an inflammatory condition that can lead to scarring and difficulty breathing.

Answer: A. Pulmonary hypertension"
531,"Question: A newborn is delivered at term to a 38-year-old woman after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. The newborn's blood pressure is 142/85 mm Hg. Examination shows clitoral enlargement and labioscrotal fusion. Serum studies show a sodium of 151 mg/dL and a potassium of 3.2 mg/dL. Karyotype analysis shows a 46, XX karyotype. The patient is most likely deficient in an enzyme that is normally responsible for which of the following reactions?

A. Progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone
B. 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone
C. Testosterone to dihydrotestosterone
D. Progesterone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone

Answer: B. 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone

Explanation:

The patient's blood pressure and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for converting progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone, and a deficiency in this enzyme leads to an accumulation of 11-deoxycorticosterone in the body. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including hypertension, clitoral enlargement, and labioscrotal fusion. The karyotype analysis showing a 46, XX karyotype also supports this diagnosis, as CAH is typically diagnosed in females.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
532,"Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents due to fever and mild abdominal pain that has lasted for 7 days, along with a recent rash. His parents also report that he developed conjunctival injection and fissures on his lower lips, an erythematous pharynx, tender cervical lymphadenopathy, edematous hands and feet, and a macular morbilliform rash on his trunk. His temperature is 39.4°C (102.9°F), pulse is 111/min, respirations are 27/min, and blood pressure is 96/65 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?

Options:

A. Oral doxycycline - Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacterial infections, including those that can cause rash and other symptoms in this patient. However, it is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition, as the cause of his symptoms is likely viral in nature.

B. Supportive treatment only - While supportive care such as hydration and pain management may be necessary, it is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition, as he requires specific antiviral therapy to address the underlying viral infection.

C. Oral penicillin - Penicillin is an antibiotic that can be effective against some bacterial infections, but it is not effective against viral infections. Therefore, it is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition.

D. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) - IVIG is a treatment that can be used to manage severe viral infections, including those that can cause rash and other symptoms in this patient. It works by providing the body with a large dose of antibodies that can help to neutralize the virus and reduce inflammation. Therefore, IVIG is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition."
533,"Question: A 57-year-old female presents to general gynecology clinic for evaluation of a pelvic mass. The mass was detected on a routine visit to her primary care doctor during abdominal palpation. In the office, she receives a transvaginal ultrasound, which reveals a mass measuring 11 cm in diameter. In the evaluation of this mass, elevation of which tumor marker would be suggestive of an ovarian cancer?

A. S-100
B. CA-125
C. Alpha fetoprotein
D. CA-19-9

Answer: B. CA-125

Explanation:

The CA-125 tumor marker is a commonly used diagnostic tool for ovarian cancer. It is a glycoprotein that is produced by the ovarian epithelium and is elevated in the blood of women with ovarian cancer. In the evaluation of a pelvic mass, an elevated CA-125 level can be suggestive of ovarian cancer, particularly when combined with other clinical and imaging findings.

The other options, S-100, Alpha fetoprotein, and CA-19-9, are not typically used as tumor markers for ovarian cancer. S-100 is a marker of neural differentiation and is elevated in some neuroendocrine tumors, but it is not specific to ovarian cancer. Alpha fetoprotein is a marker of hepatic origin and is elevated in some liver diseases, but it is not specific to ovarian cancer. CA-19-9 is a marker of pancreatic origin and is elevated in some pancreatic diseases, but it is not specific to ovarian cancer.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. CA-125."
534,"Question: The patient who was recently hospitalized with a pulmonary embolism and is on an unfractionated heparin drip as a bridge to chronic warfarin therapy develops diffuse bruising despite minimal trauma, and the heparin infusion rate is found to be faster than prescribed. Which of the following interventions would be most likely administered to reverse the effects of heparin?

Options:
A. Aminocaproic acid
B. Fresh frozen plasma
C. Platelets
D. Protamine sulfate

Answer: D. Protamine sulfate.

Explanation: Protamine sulfate is a specific antidote for heparin, which works by neutralizing the anticoagulant effects of heparin. It is commonly used to reverse the effects of heparin overdose or excessive heparin administration. Aminocaproic acid, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets are not effective antidotes for heparin."
535,"Question: An 18-year-old man is rushed to the emergency department 30 minutes after being stabbed in the chest during a fight. He has no other injuries. His pulse is 120/min, blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, and respirations are 22/min. Examination shows a 4-cm deep, straight stab wound in the 4th intercostal space 2 cm medial to the right midclavicular line. Which of the following structures is most likely to have been penetrated by the knife?

A. Pectoral fascia, transversus thoracis muscle, right lung
B. Intercostal muscles, internal thoracic artery, right heart
C. External oblique muscle, superior epigastric artery, azygos vein
D. Pectoralis minor muscle, dome of the diaphragm, right lobe of the liver

Answer: A. Pectoral fascia, transversus thoracis muscle, right lung.

Explanation: The pectoral fascia is a thin layer of connective tissue that covers the chest wall and surrounds the pectoral muscles. The transversus thoracis muscle is a thin muscle that runs across the chest, and the right lung is located in the right thoracic cavity. Therefore, it is most likely that the knife passed through the pectoral fascia and transversus thoracis muscle before reaching the right lung."

One of the identified bands matches that of a hormone with a site of action in:

A. Adipocytes
B. Adrenal gland
C. Bones
D. Thyroid gland

Answer: D. Thyroid gland

Explanation: The researcher identifies a circulating factor that appears to be responsible for the difference in progesterone behavior during pregnancy, and one of the identified bands on the western blot matches that of a hormone with a site of action in the thyroid gland. Therefore, the answer is (D) Thyroid gland."
539,"Question: A 70-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe back pain. What is the greatest risk factor for this patient's condition?

Options:
A. Obesity
B. Smoking
C. Diabetes
D. Alcohol consumption

Answer: B. Smoking

Explanation: The patient's history of smoking is the greatest risk factor for his condition. Smoking is a significant risk factor for various medical conditions, including back pain. The smoke irritates the muscles and nerves in the back, leading to inflammation and pain. The patient's smoking history increases the likelihood of developing back pain, especially in older adults. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
540,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 76-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of jagged edges and loss of central vision in his right eye, which occurred 6 hours ago and lasted for approximately 5 minutes. He has no pain and a 3-month history of intermittent blurriness in the same eye. He also reports a 10-minute episode of slurred speech and left-sided facial droop that occurred 2 months ago. The patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia, stable angina pectoris, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is taking glyburide, atorvastatin, labetalol, isosorbide, lisinopril, and aspirin. His vital signs are within normal limits, and ophthalmologic examination reveals visual acuity of 20/30 in the left eye and 20/40 in the right eye, with two pale spots along the supratemporal and inferotemporal arcade on fundoscopic examination. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings, and cardiopulmonary examination reveals systolic rumbling at the right carotid artery. An ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Echocardiography - This is not the most appropriate next step in management as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient's symptoms are related to cardiac causes.

B. Fluorescein angiography - This is not the most appropriate next step in management as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient's symptoms are related to retinal causes.

C. Reassurance and follow-up - This is the most appropriate next step in management as the patient's symptoms are likely related to a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or temporary loss of vision, which can occur without any identifiable cause. Reassurance and follow-up with an ophthalmologist are appropriate to monitor the patient's condition and determine if any further evaluation or treatment is needed.

D. Carotid duplex ultrasonography - This is the most appropriate next step in management as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a TIA or temporary loss of vision, which can be caused by a blockage in the carotid artery. Carotid duplex ultrasonography can help evaluate the patient's carotid artery circulation and determine if any further evaluation or treatment is needed."
541,"Question: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician due to fever, malaise, and severe right knee joint pain and swelling for 3 days, along with previous episodes of abdominal pain and epistaxis. Five days ago, he had swelling and pain in his left ankle joint which has since resolved. He also reports a sore throat 3 weeks ago while camping in the woods. His immunizations are up-to-date. Examination shows a swollen, tender right knee with limited range of motion, and painless 3- to 4-mm nodules over the elbow. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal. His hemoglobin concentration is 12.3 g/dL, leukocyte count is 11,800/mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 58 mm/h. Arthrocentesis of the right knee joint yields clear, straw-colored fluid with no organisms identified on Gram stain. Analysis of the synovial fluid shows a leukocyte count of 1,350/mm3 with 17% neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Acute rheumatic fever: The patient's symptoms of fever, malaise, and severe knee joint pain and swelling, along with the presence of painless nodules over the elbow, are consistent with acute rheumatic fever. The patient's history of sore throat 3 weeks ago also supports this diagnosis, as acute rheumatic fever is a known complication of streptococcal infections.

B. Lyme disease: While Lyme disease can cause joint pain and swelling, the patient's symptoms of fever, malaise, and severe knee joint pain and swelling, along with the presence of painless nodules over the elbow, are more consistent with acute rheumatic fever. Lyme disease is more likely to cause multiple joint pain and swelling, and the patient's history of sore throat 3 weeks ago does not support this diagnosis.

C. Kawasaki disease: Kawasaki disease is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause fever, malaise, and swelling of the lymph nodes, along with inflammation of the coronary arteries. However, the patient's symptoms of severe knee joint pain and swelling, along with the presence of painless nodules over the elbow, are more consistent with acute rheumatic fever. The patient's age and the absence of coronary artery inflammation also make Kawasaki disease less likely.

D. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that can cause joint pain and swelling, but the patient's symptoms of fever, malaise, and severe knee joint pain and swelling, along with the presence of painless nodules over the elbow, are more consistent with acute rheumatic fever. The patient's age and the absence of a known trigger for the joint pain and swelling also make juvenile idiopathic arthritis less likely."
542,"Question: A 55-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for diarrhea. He states that he has experienced roughly 10 episodes of non-bloody and watery diarrhea every day for the past 3 days. The patient has a past medical history of IV drug abuse and recently completed treatment for an abscess with cellulitis. His vitals are notable for a pulse of 105/min. Physical exam reveals diffuse abdominal discomfort with palpation but no focal tenderness. A rectal exam is within normal limits and is Guaiac negative. Which of the following is the best initial treatment for this patient?

Options:

A. Clindamycin - Clindamycin is an antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacterial pathogens, including some that can cause diarrhea. However, in this patient's case, the diarrhea is likely due to a viral infection, and clindamycin would not be the best initial treatment.

B. Metronidazole - Metronidazole is an antibiotic that is effective against some bacterial pathogens that can cause diarrhea, such as Clostridioides difficile. However, it is not effective against viral pathogens, and the patient's diarrhea is likely due to a viral infection.

C. Oral rehydration and discharge - Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is a crucial initial treatment for diarrhea, as it helps replace lost fluids and electrolytes. However, in this patient's case, the diarrhea is severe and frequent, and ORT alone may not be sufficient to manage the symptoms. Discharge with instructions to follow up with a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist, is also appropriate.

D. Vancomycin - Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is effective against some bacterial pathogens that can cause diarrhea, such as C. difficile. However, it is not effective against viral pathogens, and the patient's diarrhea is likely due to a viral infection. Therefore, vancomycin is not the best initial treatment for this patient.

Answer: D. Vancomycin."
543,"Question: The 18-month-old boy is brought in for a routine check-up, and his parents express concern about his language development and potential developmental delay. Upon examination, the patient's temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 108/72 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 14/min. The patient's weight and length have not increased significantly in the past 3 months, but he is now in the 25th percentile for weight and the 90th percentile for head circumference. The patient's facial features have changed significantly, with a long face, prominent forehead, and protruding eyes. Additionally, the patient has corneal clouding bilaterally and keeps his mouth hanging open at rest. After extensive workup, the patient is found to have 2 mutated copies of the IDUA gene, with no production of the protein iduronidase. Which of the following is the likely mutation found in this disease?

A. Chromosomal translocation - This is not the likely mutation found in the disease, as it involves the transfer of a chromosomal segment from one chromosome to another, which is not associated with a nonsense mutation in the IDUA gene.

B. Interstitial deletion - This is also not the likely mutation found in the disease, as it involves the deletion of a segment of DNA within a chromosome, which is not associated with a nonsense mutation in the IDUA gene.

C. Nonsense mutation - This is the likely mutation found in the disease, as it involves the substitution of a premature stop codon in the IDUA gene, which leads to the absence of the iduronidase protein.

D. Silent mutation - This is not the likely mutation found in the disease, as silent mutations do not result in the loss of protein function.

Answer: C. Nonsense mutation."

545,"Question: A 9-year-old boy is brought to the psychiatrist due to unusual behavior over the past several months. His mother reports that he has started blinking more frequently than usual. Despite multiple disciplinary efforts and behavioral therapy from a clinical psychologist, he has not stopped this behavior. He previously performed well in school but has become more disruptive and inattentive in class. He has not been sick recently and denies any drug use. His parents report multiple episodes in which the child seemed overly elated and hyperactive for several days followed by periods in which he felt sad and withdrawn. On examination, he is a well-appearing boy in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented with a normal affect but gets distracted easily throughout the exam. He blinks both eyes several times throughout the examination. Strength, sensation, and gait are all normal. Which of the following medications is most appropriate for this patient?

Options:

A. Guanfacine: Guanfacine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that can help manage symptoms of ADHD, such as inattention and hyperactivity. Its sedative effects can also help reduce excessive blinking.

B. Lithium: Lithium is a mood stabilizer that can help regulate emotional changes and reduce symptoms of bipolar disorder. While it may not directly address excessive blinking, it can help manage the underlying mood disorder that may be contributing to the patient's behavior.

C. Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that can help manage symptoms of depression and anxiety. While it may not directly address excessive blinking, it can help manage the underlying mood disorder that may be contributing to the patient's behavior.

D. Venlafaxine: Venlafaxine is an SSRI that can help manage symptoms of depression and anxiety. Like fluoxetine, it may not directly address excessive blinking, but it can help manage the underlying mood disorder that may be contributing to the patient's behavior.

Answer: A. Guanfacine"
546,"Question: A 26-year-old G2P1 undergoes labor induction at 40 weeks gestation. The estimated fetal weight was 3890 g. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes treated with insulin. The vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg, heart rate 91/min, respiratory rate 21/min, and temperature 36.8℃ (98.2℉). The blood workup yields the following results:

A. 5% dextrose: Administering 5% dextrose during labor can help maintain the mother's blood sugar levels and prevent hypoglycemia, which can be a complication of insulin therapy.

B. Intravenous regular insulin: Administering intravenous regular insulin during labor can help manage the mother's blood sugar levels and prevent hyperglycemia, which can be a complication of gestational diabetes.

C. Erythrocyte mass: Erythrocyte mass is not relevant to the management of gestational diabetes or labor.

D. Subcutaneous insulin: Subcutaneous insulin is not administered during labor, as it is used for long-acting insulin therapy and is not suitable for immediate management of blood sugar levels during labor.

Answer: A. 5% dextrose"
547,"Question: A 31-year-old G1P0 woman with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department because she believes she is in labor. She is in her 38th week of pregnancy and her course has been uncomplicated. This morning, she began feeling painful contractions and noticed vaginal bleeding after falling off her bike while riding to work. She is experiencing lower abdominal and pelvic pain between contractions as well. Her temperature is 97.6°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 177/99 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a gravid and hypertonic uterus and moderate blood in the vaginal vault. Ultrasound reveals no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Abruptio placentae: Given the patient's history of hypertension and the presence of vaginal bleeding, abruptio placentae (placental separation) is the most likely diagnosis. This condition can occur in the third trimester and is often associated with high blood pressure and bleeding.

B. Normal labor: The patient's contractions and bleeding may be a sign of normal labor, but without further evaluation, it is difficult to determine if this is the case.

C. Placenta previa: The patient's bleeding and lower abdominal pain may be indicative of placenta previa (placenta located low in the uterine cavity), but the absence of other symptoms such as abdominal pain or back pain makes this diagnosis less likely.

D. Uterine rupture: While the patient's history of hypertension increases her risk for uterine rupture, the absence of other symptoms such as sudden severe abdominal pain or back pain makes this diagnosis less likely.

Answer: A. Abruptio placentae"
548,"Question: A parent seeks information about immunizations for their newborn from their pediatrician. The pediatrician explains the basic principles of immunization, different types of vaccines, potential side effects, and the immunization schedule. To illustrate how immunizations work, the pediatrician explains that there are primarily two types of vaccines. The first type of vaccine provides stronger and longer-lasting immunity by inducing both cellular and humoral immune responses. The second type of vaccine triggers mainly a humoral response, resulting in less overall efficacy compared to the first type. Which vaccine belongs to the first category that the pediatrician mentioned?

Options:
A. Yellow fever vaccine
B. Rabies vaccine
C. Hepatitis A vaccine
D. Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine

Answer: A. Yellow fever vaccine"
549,"Question: A 57-year-old otherwise healthy male presents to his primary care physician for a check-up. He has no complaints. His blood pressure at the previous visit was 160/95. The patient did not wish to be on any medications and at the time attempted to manage his blood pressure with diet and exercise. On repeat measurement of blood pressure today, the reading is 163/92. His physician decides to prescribe a medication which the patient agrees to take. The patient calls his physician 6 days later complaining of a persistent cough, but otherwise states that his BP was measured as 145/85 at a local pharmacy. Which of the following is a contraindication to this medication?

Options:

A. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
B. Gout
C. Bilateral renal artery stenosis (BRS)
D. Congestive heart failure (CHF)

Answer: C. Bilateral renal artery stenosis (BRS)

Explanation: Bilateral renal artery stenosis is a contraindication to this medication because the medication can increase blood pressure, which can exacerbate the narrowing of the renal arteries and potentially lead to kidney damage or failure. The patient's persistent cough is a concerning symptom that may indicate an adverse reaction to the medication, but it is not a contraindication in and of itself. COPD and gout are not contraindications to this medication, as they are unrelated to the patient's blood pressure or the medication's mechanism of action. CHF is also not a contraindication, as it is not a condition that affects the patient's blood pressure or the medication's efficacy."
550,"Question: A 5-year-old male is brought to his pediatrician after recurrent, prolonged upper respiratory infections over a period of several months. Physical exam reveals petechiae on the patient's legs and arms. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin: 10 g/L, platelet count: 35,000/mm^3, leukocyte count: 6,600/mm^3. A bone marrow aspiration shows an abundance of lymphoblasts indicative of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Positive immunostaining for which of the following would support a diagnosis of precursor B-cell leukemia?

A. TdT, HER-2
B. CD19, CD10
C. CD30, CD15
D. CD4, CD5

Answer: B. CD19, CD10

Explanation:

The presence of petechiae on the patient's legs and arms, along with the laboratory findings of hemoglobin of 10 g/L, platelet count of 35,000/mm^3, and leukocyte count of 6,600/mm^3, suggest that the patient has a hematological disorder. The diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is further supported by the bone marrow aspiration showing an abundance of lymphoblasts.

Positive immunostaining for CD19 and CD10 on the bone marrow cells would support a diagnosis of precursor B-cell leukemia, as these proteins are typically expressed in B cells at different stages of development. TdT is a protein involved in the regulation of DNA repair and is not typically expressed in B cells. CD30 and CD15 are markers that are not specific to B cells and cannot be used to support a diagnosis of precursor B-cell leukemia.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) CD19, CD10."
551,"Question: A 41-year-old woman presents to urgent care with complaints of a new rash and bilateral ankle pain. On review of systems, she has no additional localized complaints. Physical examination reveals numerous red subcutaneous nodules overlying her shins, bilaterally. Complete blood count shows leukocytes 7,300, Hct 46.2%, Hgb 18.1 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 88 fL, and platelets 209. Chest radiography demonstrates bilateral hilar adenopathy with clear lungs. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Coccidioidomycosis - This fungal infection is commonly found in the southwestern United States and can cause skin rashes and lymph node enlargement. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

B. Sarcoidosis - The patient's symptoms of bilateral ankle pain and skin rash, along with the finding of bilateral hilar adenopathy on chest radiography, are highly suggestive of sarcoidosis. This chronic inflammatory disease can affect various organ systems, including the skin and lungs.

C. Chlamydophila pneumoniae - While this bacterial infection can cause pneumonia and skin rashes, the patient's complete blood count and chest radiography findings do not support this diagnosis.

D. Histoplasmosis - This fungal infection is commonly found in the midwestern and southeastern United States and can cause skin rashes and lung disease. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Answer: B. Sarcoidosis."
552,"Question: A 29-year-old man presents to the clinic with several days of flatulence and greasy, foul-smelling diarrhea. He says that he was on a camping trip last week after which his symptoms started. When asked further about his camping activities, he reports collecting water from a stream but did not boil or chemically treat the water. The patient also reports nausea, weight loss, and abdominal cramps followed by sudden diarrhea. He denies tenesmus, urgency, and bloody diarrhea. His temperature is 37°C (98.6° F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 107/min, and blood pressure is 89/58 mm Hg. A physical examination is performed where nothing significant was found except for dry mucous membranes. Intravenous fluids are started and a stool sample is sent to the lab, which reveals motile protozoa on microscopy, negative for any ova, no blood cells, and pus cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Giardiasis

B. C. difficile colitis

C. Irritable bowel syndrome

D. Traveler’s diarrhea due to Norovirus

Answer: A. Giardiasis

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of flatulence, greasy and foul-smelling diarrhea, nausea, weight loss, and abdominal cramps are consistent with giardiasis, a parasitic infection caused by the protozoan Giardia duodenalis. The fact that the patient collected water from a stream without proper treatment increases the likelihood of giardiasis, as Giardia can be found in contaminated water sources. The absence of ova and blood cells in the stool sample, as well as the presence of motile protozoa on microscopy, further support this diagnosis. While C. difficile colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and Traveler’s diarrhea due to Norovirus can also cause similar symptoms, the likelihood of these diagnoses is lower based on the patient's history and laboratory results."
553,"Question: A 59-year-old woman with a history of chronic kidney disease presents with a 3-month history of easy fatigability. Physical examination reveals subconjunctival pallor. Her hemoglobin concentration is 8.9 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume is 86 μm3, and serum ferritin is 225 ng/mL. Treatment with erythropoietin is initiated. A peripheral blood smear is obtained one week later, and a photomicrograph of the smear after specialized staining is shown. The prominent color of the intracellular structure in some of the cells is most likely due to staining of which of the following?

Options:

A. Ribosomal RNA - The prominent color of the intracellular structure in some of the cells is likely due to the staining of ribosomal RNA, which is a major component of the rough endoplasmic reticulum in red blood cells.

B. Denatured globin chains - Denatured globin chains can also cause a similar staining pattern, but this is less common in red blood cells.

C. Remnants of the nucleus - The remnants of the nucleus are not a likely cause of the staining pattern observed in the photomicrograph.

D. Mitochondria - Mitochondria are not a significant source of staining in red blood cells.

Answer: A. Ribosomal RNA"
554,"Question: A 34-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider with intermittent bright pink urine over several days, concerned it may be due to blood in her urine. Her medical history is unremarkable, she has not been sick in the past weeks, and her only medication is for pelvic pain associated with her menstrual period. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. Upon examination, she has 2+ pitting edema up to her knees, and a urinalysis reveals red blood cells, red blood cell casts, and acanthocytes. No proteinuria was detected. Her serum creatinine is 2.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 42 mg/dL, serum potassium 4.8 mEq/L, serum sodium 140 mEq/L, and serum chloride 102 mEq/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this case?

A. Discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, as the patient's urinalysis findings suggest possible kidney damage.
B. Administration of fomepizole, a drug that can help manage the symptoms of acute kidney injury.
C. Intravenous fluid therapy and electrolyte correction to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances in the patient's urine output.
D. Renal biopsy, a invasive procedure that can provide a definitive diagnosis of the underlying kidney disease.

Answer: D. Renal biopsy

Rationale: The patient's urinalysis findings suggest possible kidney damage, and a renal biopsy can provide a definitive diagnosis of the underlying kidney disease. The other options are not appropriate for managing this case, as they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Discontinuation of NSAID use (Option A) may be necessary, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's kidney damage. Administration of fomepizole (Option B) may help manage the symptoms of acute kidney injury, but it does not provide a definitive diagnosis of the underlying disease. Intravenous fluid therapy and electrolyte correction (Option C) may be necessary to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's kidney damage."
555,"Question: A 72-year-old woman presents with left lower limb swelling. She first noticed her left leg was swollen about 2 weeks ago, and she denies any pain. Which of the following veins help to prevent this patient's condition from happening?

Options:
A. Giacomini vein
B. Perforator veins
C. Accessory saphenous vein
D. Deep femoral vein

Answer: B. Perforator veins.

Explanation: Perforator veins are a network of small veins that branch off from the larger superficial veins and connect to the deep veins. They play a crucial role in preventing venous stagnation and thrombosis in the lower limbs. In this case, the obstructing thrombosis of the distal portion of the femoral vein is likely due to inadequate drainage of blood through the perforator veins, which can lead to venous stagnation and thrombosis. The Giacomini vein, accessory saphenous vein, and deep femoral vein are not directly involved in preventing this condition."
556,"Question: A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with fever, diarrhea, and dysuria for the past day. She also complains of palpitations, poor concentration, and severe anxiety. She was diagnosed with Graves disease 6 months ago but admits that she has missed some doses of her prescribed medications in the past couple of months due to stress. Her temperature is 103°F (39°C) and pulse is 132/minute. A urine culture is obtained and grows Escherichia coli. Which of the following drugs would be most effective in treating this patient's acute condition?

Options:

A. Lithium - This drug is not effective in treating the patient's acute condition as it is used to treat bipolar disorder and not for managing symptoms of Graves disease.

B. Methimazole - This drug is commonly used to treat hyperthyroidism, which is a symptom of Graves disease. However, it may not be effective in managing the patient's current acute symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, and dysuria.

C. Nitrofurantoin - This drug is an antibiotic that is effective in treating urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli, but it may not be effective in managing the patient's acute symptoms.

D. Propanolol - This drug is a beta-blocker that is commonly used to treat hypertension, tremors, and anxiety. It may be effective in managing the patient's acute symptoms of palpitations, poor concentration, and severe anxiety.

Antibiotic therapy with levofloxacin is initiated, but the patient experiences a seizure and difficulty coordinating movements with his left hand 3 days later. Which of the following medications is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?

A) Vancomycin: Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including some atypical organisms. However, it may not be the best choice for this patient given the presence of a brain lesion and the possibility of a central nervous system infection.

B) Piperacillin/tazobactam: Piperacillin is a broad-spectrum penicillin that is effective against many gram-negative bacteria, including some that can cause pneumonia. However, it may not be effective against the gram-positive bacteria that are likely causing the patient's infection.

C) Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is a combination antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. It is often used to treat community-acquired pneumonia and may be a good choice for this patient given the presence of a lung infection.

D) Erythromycin: Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including some atypical organisms.

561,"Question: A 15-year-old girl presents to the physician with her father for evaluation of short stature. She feels well overall but is concerned because all of her friends are taller than her. Her birth weight was normal, menarche has not yet occurred, and her father had similar issues. She is currently at the 5th percentile for height and 35th percentile for weight. Breast development is Tanner stage 2, and pubic and axillary hair is absent. An X-ray of the left hand and wrist shows a bone age of 12 years. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to reveal which of the following sets of laboratory findings?

$$$ FSH %%% LH %%% Estrogen %%% GnRH $$$

A. Decreased levels of FSH, LH, estrogen, and GnRH.
B. Decreased levels of FSH, LH, and estrogen, with normal GnRH levels.
C. Normal levels of all hormones.
D. Increased levels of FSH, LH, estrogen, and GnRH.

Answer: C. Normal normal normal normal.

Explanation:

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis dysfunction. The bone age of 12 years on X-ray suggests that the patient's bones are developing more slowly than expected, which is consistent with a hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis dysfunction.

The HPG axis regulates growth and development, including bone growth, and any dysfunction can lead to short stature. The normal levels of FSH, LH, estrogen, and GnRH in this case suggest that the HPG axis is functioning normally, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Therefore, the most likely set of laboratory findings in this case is normal levels of all hormones, which is option C."
562,"Question: A 32-year-old pregnant woman presents to the clinic with complaints of cramping, abdominal pain, and severe watery diarrhea for the past 3 days. She also is nauseous and complains of fever and malaise. She was started on a 7-day course of amoxicillin after being admitted to the hospital for pyelonephritis 5 days ago. The vital signs include heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 38.9°C (102.0°F), and blood pressure 92/56 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals abdominal distention with diffuse tenderness. Laboratory studies show a peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count of 15,000/mm3 and stool guaiac positive for occult blood. Which of the following is the best pharmacotherapy for her condition?

A. Metronidazole: Metronidazole is an effective antibiotic against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including Bacteroides fragilis, which is a common cause of pyelonephritis. However, it may not be the best choice for this patient due to the risk of adverse effects on the developing fetus.

B. Rifaximin: Rifaximin is a rifamycin antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli and Klebsiella, which are common causes of pyelonephritis. It is generally well-tolerated and has a good safety profile, making it a good option for pregnant women.

C. IV metronidazole plus oral vancomycin: This combination is often used to treat complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in pregnant women, as it provides broad coverage against a wide range of bacteria. However, the use of intravenous metronidazole may not be necessary in this patient, as her symptoms are mild and she has been treated with oral amoxicillin already.

D. Oral vancomycin: Vancomycin is an effective antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus saprophyticus, which can cause UTIs. However, it may not be the best choice for this patient due to the risk of adverse effects on the developing fetus.

Answer: D. Oral vancomycin. While vancomycin is effective against a wide range of bacteria, its use in pregnant women is limited due to concerns about fetal toxicity. In this case, oral vancomycin may be a safer option than the other choices, as it has a good safety profile and can provide broad coverage against gram-positive bacteria."
563,"Question: A healthy 28-year-old woman at 30-weeks gestational age has gained 35lbs since becoming pregnant. She complains of several weeks of bilateral numbness and tingling of her palms, thumbs, index and middle fingers that is worse at night. She also notes weakness gripping objects at the office. Which nerve is most likely affected?

Options:
A. Median nerve: The median nerve is responsible for supplying sensation to the palmar side of the thumb, index finger, and long finger, as well as the ulnar side of the little finger and half of the ring finger. The numbness and tingling in the patient's palms, thumbs, and fingers, especially at night, suggests that the median nerve is most likely affected.

B. Ulnar nerve: The ulnar nerve supplies sensation to the small and ring fingers, as well as the ulnar side of the little finger. The patient's symptoms of numbness and tingling in the small and ring fingers, as well as the ulnar side of the little finger, suggest that the ulnar nerve may be affected.

C. Radial nerve: The radial nerve supplies sensation to the back of the forearm, as well as the back of the hand and fingers. While the patient's symptoms could potentially be related to the radial nerve, the distribution of numbness and tingling in the palms, thumbs, and fingers suggests that the median nerve is more likely affected.

D. Anterior interosseous nerve: The anterior interosseous nerve is responsible for supplying sensation to the palmar side of the hand, including the thumb, index finger, and long finger. While the patient's symptoms could potentially be related to the anterior interosseous nerve, the distribution of numbness and tingling in the palms, thumbs, and fingers suggests that the median nerve is more likely affected.

564,"Question: The 27-year-old woman presents her newborn to the clinic for evaluation, 3 months after giving birth to a boy. She did not receive prenatal care and cannot remember the name of the medication she was taking for her mood swings. The baby was born cyanotic with a congenital heart malformation characterized by apical displacement of the septa and posterior tricuspid valve leaflets. A chest radiograph is shown in the image. Which medication was the mother most likely taking during pregnancy?

Options:
A. Buspirone
B. Clozapine
C. Lithium
D. Enalapril

Answer: C. Lithium.

Explanation: The baby's congenital heart malformation, characterized by apical displacement of the septa and posterior tricuspid valve leaflets, is a known side effect of lithium exposure during pregnancy. Lithium is a commonly used medication for mood stabilization, and its use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of congenital heart defects. The other options, buspirone, clozapine, and enalapril, are not associated with this particular congenital heart defect."
565,"Question: A 44-year-old G5P3 presents with a 2-year history of leaking urine upon exerting herself, coughing, and laughing. Her symptoms are only present in the daytime. She denies urgency, nocturia, or painful urination. She has no menstrual cycle disturbances. Her husband is her only sexual partner. She has a 12 pack-year smoking history, a 3-year history of chronic bronchitis, and a 3-year history of arterial hypertension. She takes fosinopril (10 mg), metoprolol (50 mg), and atorvastatin (10 mg) daily. Her weight is 88 kg (194 lb) and the height is 160 cm (5.2 ft). On examination, the vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg, heart rate 78/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.7℃ (98℉). Lung auscultation revealed bilateral lower lobe rales. No costovertebral angle or suprapubic tenderness are present. Which of the following findings is most likely to be revealed by the gynecologic examination?

A. Rectocele: This is the most likely finding to be revealed by the gynecologic examination. A rectocele is a prolapse of the rectum into the vagina, which can cause urinary incontinence in some cases. The patient's history of leaking urine upon exerting herself, coughing, and laughing suggests that a rectocele may be contributing to her symptoms.

B. Ovarian mass: An ovarian mass is a possible cause of pelvic pain and irregular menstrual cycles, but it is less likely to be responsible for the patient's urinary incontinence.

C. Purulent cervical discharge: Purulent cervical discharge is a sign of a cervical infection, but it is not typically associated with urinary incontinence.

D. Cystocele: A cystocele is a prolapse of the bladder into the vagina, which can cause urinary incontinence. However, the patient's history of leaking urine only upon exerting herself, coughing, and laughing suggests that a rectocele may be more likely."

Question: A 37-year-old woman comes for prenatal counseling at 18 weeks gestation, revealing that her sister recently gave birth to a child with Down's syndrome. The patient requests prenatal screening for Down's in her current pregnancy. Which of the following prenatal screening tests and results would raise concern for Down's syndrome?

Options:

A. Increased AFP, normal HCG, normal unconjugated estriol - This combination of results is within the normal range and does not indicate an increased risk of Down's syndrome.

B. Decreased AFP, increased HCG, decreased unconjugated estriol - A decrease in AFP and an increase in HCG, along with a decrease in unconjugated estriol, could raise concern for Down's syndrome, as these changes are commonly seen in pregnancies with Down's syndrome.

C. Normal AFP, increased HCG, decreased unconjugated estriol - While a normal AFP and increased HCG are generally seen in healthy pregnancies, a decrease in unconjugated estriol could indicate a higher risk of Down's syndrome.

D. Normal AFP, decreased HCG, decreased unconjugated estriol - A decrease in both AFP and HCG, along with a decrease in unconjugated estriol, would also raise concern for Down's syndrome, as these changes are commonly seen in pregnancies with Down's syndrome.

Answer: B. Decreased AFP, increased HCG, decreased unconjugated estriol."

569,"Question: A 29-year-old G1P0 woman at 24 weeks gestation presents to her physician with complaints of burning with urination, and she reports that she has been urinating much more frequently than usual over the past several days. She otherwise is doing well and has experienced no complications with her pregnancy or vaginal discharge. Her temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 112/82 mmHg, pulse is 89/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Examination is significant for suprapubic discomfort upon palpation and a gravid uterus. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis shows increased leukocyte esterase, elevated nitrites, 55 leukocytes/hpf, and bacteria. The physician prescribes a 7-day course of nitrofurantoin. Which of the following is the next best step in management?

A. Add ciprofloxacin to antibiotic regimen: Incorrect. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that is effective against gram-negative bacteria, but it is not the best choice for treating a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus saprophyticus, which is the most common cause of UTIs during pregnancy.

B. Add penicillin to antibiotic regimen: Incorrect. Penicillin is effective against gram-positive bacteria, but it may not be the best choice for treating a UTI caused by Staphylococcus saprophyticus, as it may not penetrate the kidneys effectively.

C. Perform a renal ultrasound: Incorrect. A renal ultrasound is not necessary to diagnose or manage a UTI during pregnancy.

D. Send a urine culture: Correct. A urine culture is the next best step in management to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection and to guide antibiotic selection. The physician should send a urine culture to the laboratory for analysis to identify the type of bacteria causing the infection and to determine the appropriate antibiotic therapy."
570,"Question: A 35-year-old man presents to his primary care provider in Philadelphia with a skin rash on his right thigh. He reports that the rash appeared 3 days ago. He recently returned from a weeklong trip to his vacation home in central Pennsylvania. He denies pain, numbness, paresthesias, itchiness, or burning around the rash. He does not recall finding any ticks on his body. He otherwise feels well. His past medical history is notable for gout. He takes allopurinol. He is an avid hiker and spends 3 months out of the year hiking. He does not smoke and drinks alcohol socially. On exam, he has a bullseye-like circular erythematous rash on the anterolateral aspect of his right thigh. The doctor decides to perform a new serum test for Lyme disease that was trialed at the same hospital in Philadelphia, where it was shown to have a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 94%. The prevalence of Lyme disease in the area is among the highest in the country. How would the sensitivity and specificity of this new test change if it were performed on a patient in Texas, an area with a very low prevalence of Lyme disease?

A. The sensitivity of the test would decrease in Texas compared to Philadelphia due to the lower prevalence of Lyme disease in the area.
B. The specificity of the test would decrease in Texas compared to Philadelphia due to the lower prevalence of Lyme disease in the area.
C. The sensitivity and specificity of the test would remain the same in Texas as they were in Philadelphia.
D. The test would not be able to accurately diagnose Lyme disease in Texas due to the low prevalence of the disease in the area.

Answer: A. The sensitivity of the test would decrease in Texas compared to Philadelphia due to the lower prevalence of Lyme disease in the area."
571,"Question: A 65-year-old woman is rushed to the emergency department due to left wrist pain and swelling that started after she fell from a seated position. Menopause occurred 15 years ago. Her serum parathyroid hormone level is within normal limits. An x-ray of the left wrist reveals a nondisplaced fracture of the distal radial metaphysis and decreased bone mineral density. Which of the following compounds would benefit this patient the most?

Options:
A. Inositol
B. Keratan sulfate
C. Hydroxyapatite
D. Pyrophosphate

Answer: D. Pyrophosphate.

Explanation: The patient's decreased bone mineral density and nondisplaced fracture of the distal radial metaphysis suggest a condition known as osteoporosis, which is characterized by a loss of bone mass and density. Pyrophosphate is a substance that plays a crucial role in bone mineralization and density, making it the most suitable option for the patient's condition. Inositol, keratan sulfate, and hydroxyapatite are not directly involved in bone mineralization or density, making them less relevant for the patient's treatment."
572,"Question: Nine healthy subjects participate in a study of gastric secretions. Subjects are asked to eat a meal at hour 0, at which time the pH of stomach contents and rate of stomach acid secretions are measured over the next 4 hours. Results of the study are shown. Which of the following mediators is most active at point A in the graph?

Options:
A. Prostaglandin
B. Somatostatin
C. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide
D. Acetylcholine

Answer: D. Acetylcholine

Explanation:
The graph shows the pH of stomach contents and rate of stomach acid secretions over time. At point A, the pH of stomach contents is at its lowest, indicating the highest acid secretion. Acetylcholine is a mediator that stimulates the production of stomach acid, making it the most active mediator at point A in the graph. Prostaglandin, Somatostatin, and Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide are not involved in regulating stomach acid secretions. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
573,"Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother with a history of fever for the past 3 days, yellow nasal discharge, and a severe earache in the right ear. He has no prior history of ear infections and is otherwise healthy. The physician suspects that the infectious agent is Streptococcus pneumoniae and prescribes the appropriate treatment. Which of the following is true about the mechanism of antigen processing in this example?

A. The pathway involved allows for recognition of extracellular antigens.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause pneumonia, meningitis, and other infections. The mechanism of antigen processing in this example involves the recognition of extracellular antigens, which are proteins or carbohydrates that are exposed on the surface of the bacteria and can be recognized by the immune system. The pathway involved in this process is called the ""extracellular pathway,"" which involves the recognition of antigens by antibodies or T cells on the surface of immune cells.

B. The antigen is directly bound to the MHC I.

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I is a protein complex found on the surface of many cell types, including immune cells. MHC I binds to peptides, which are small protein fragments, and presents them to T cells for recognition. However, in the case of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, the antigen is not directly bound to MHC I, but rather is recognized through the extracellular pathway.

C. The target cell involved is a CD8+ T cell.

CD8+ T cells, also known as cytotoxic T cells, are a type of immune cell that recognizes and kills infected cells or tumor cells that display viral or bacterial antigens on their surface. However, in the case of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, the target cell involved is not a CD8+ T cell, but rather immune cells that recognize the bacteria through the extracellular pathway.

D. The pathway involved allows for recognition of intracellular antigens.

Streptococcus pneumoniae can also infect immune cells and present antigens to the immune system through an intracellular pathway. However, in the example provided, the mechanism of antigen processing involves the recognition of extracellular antigens, not intracellular antigens."
574,"Question: A 56-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of heartburn, belching, and epigastric pain that is aggravated by coffee and fatty foods. She states that she has recently been having difficulty swallowing in addition to her usual symptoms. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?

Options:

A. Nissen fundoplication - This surgical procedure involves wrapping the upper part of the stomach around the lower esophagus to strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and prevent acid reflux. While this procedure can be effective in treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), it is not the most appropriate next step for this patient given her recent onset of difficulty swallowing.

B. Lifestyle changes - don't lie down after eating; avoid spicy foods; eat small servings - While these lifestyle modifications can help manage symptoms of GERD, they may not address the patient's recent onset of difficulty swallowing.

C. Trial of an H2 receptor antagonist - H2 receptor antagonists can help reduce acid production in the stomach, which may help alleviate symptoms of GERD. However, this option may not be the most appropriate next step for this patient given her recent onset of difficulty swallowing.

D. Upper endoscopy - An upper endoscopy is a diagnostic procedure that allows the physician to visualize the inside of the esophagus and stomach. This procedure can help identify any abnormalities, such as inflammation, ulcers, or tumors, that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Therefore, an upper endoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient."
575,"Question: A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to severe epigastric pain and vomiting for the past 4 hours. The pain is constant, radiates to his back, and worsens on lying down. He has had 3-4 episodes of greenish-colored vomit. He was treated for H. pylori infection 2 months ago with triple-regimen therapy. He has atrial fibrillation and hypertension. He drinks 4-5 alcoholic beverages daily. Current medications include dabigatran and metoprolol. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 102/min, and blood pressure is 138/86 mmHg. Examination shows severe epigastric tenderness to palpation with guarding but no rebound. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. Rectal examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:

Hematocrit: 53%
Leukocyte count: 11,300/mm3
Serum Na+: 133 mEq/L
Cl-: 98 mEq/L
K+: 3.1 mEq/L

γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT): 88 u/L (N=5-50 U/L)
Lipase: 900 U/L (N=14-280 U/L)

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Calcium gluconate therapy
B. Fomepizole therapy
C. Laparotomy
D. Crystalloid fluid infusion

Answer: D. Crystalloid fluid infusion

The patient's symptoms of severe epigastric pain, vomiting, and abdominal tenderness, along with his elevated liver enzymes and GGT, suggest a possible diagnosis of acute alcoholic hepatitis. Crystalloid fluid infusion is the most appropriate next step in management as it will help to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances, improve perfusion of vital organs, and provide supportive care for the patient until further evaluation and treatment can be provided. Calcium gluconate therapy may be considered if the patient's electrolyte levels are severely imbalanced, but it is not the most appropriate choice for managing acute alcoholic hepatitis. Fomepizole therapy is not recommended for the management of acute alcoholic hepatitis as it is primarily used to treat acute alcohol poisoning. Laparotomy is not a reasonable next step in management as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a surgical emergency."
576,"Question: A 7-month-old boy presents to the emergency room with three episodes of vomiting and severe abdominal pain that comes and goes over the past two hours. The patient's most recent vomit in the hospital appears bilious, and the patient had one stool that appears bloody and full of mucus. The mother explains that one stool at home appeared to be ""jelly-like."" On physical exam, a palpable mass is felt in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. What is the next best diagnostic test for this patient?

Options:

A. Peripheral blood culture - This test is not relevant to the patient's symptoms, as there is no evidence of an infection.

B. Kidney, ureter, bladder radiograph - This test is also not relevant, as it does not help diagnose the cause of the patient's abdominal pain or bloody stool.

C. Complete blood count with differential - This test may be useful in identifying an underlying infection or inflammatory process, but it is not specific to the patient's current symptoms.

D. Abdominal ultrasound - This test is the next best diagnostic test for this patient, as it can help identify the location and size of any abdominal masses or fluid accumulation, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. An ultrasound can also help rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a bowel obstruction or appendicitis."

579,"Question: A 58-year-old man with an unknown previous medical history is found on the floor at home by his daughter. During the initial assessment, the patient has right-sided arm weakness and incomprehensible speech. The patient is admitted to the hospital where he is diagnosed with an ischemic stroke where his magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan showed diffusion restriction in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. Further evaluation reveals the patient had been on the floor for about 2 days before he was found by his daughter. At presentation to the hospital, the blood pressure is 161/88 mm Hg and the heart rate is 104/min and regular. His laboratory values at the time of admission are shown:

BUN 40 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.9 mg/dL
Potassium 5.3 mEq/dL
Sodium 155 mEq/dL
Chloride 100 mEq/dL
HCO3 24 mmol/L
Hemoglobin 13.8 g/dL
Hematocrit 40%
Leukocytes 11,000/mL
Platelets 300,000/μL
Serum creatine kinase 40,000 U/L

Which of the following is most indicated in this patient?

A. Forced diuresis with intravenous (IV) fluids:

The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels suggest that he may have developed acute kidney injury (AKI) due to dehydration. Forced diuresis with IV fluids can help to restore fluid and electrolyte balance, reduce BUN and creatinine levels, and improve renal function. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice.

B. Stress echocardiography:

While stress echocardiography can help to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and rule out cardiac etiologies of his symptoms, it is not the most indicated test in this case. The patient's recent stroke and acute kidney injury are more pressing concerns that require urgent attention.

C. Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP):

FFP is a blood product that contains clotting factors and can help to treat bleeding disorders. However, the patient's recent stroke and acute kidney injury may indicate a higher risk of bleeding complications, which would make FFP less appropriate.

D. Rhythm control with metoprolol:

The patient's elevated heart rate and regular heart rhythm suggest that he may have tachycardia, which can be managed with medications such as metoprolol. However, the patient's recent stroke and acute kidney injury are more pressing concerns that require urgent attention, and rhythm control may not be the most appropriate intervention at this time."
580,"Question: Seven days after undergoing bilateral total knee arthroplasty, a 65-year-old man presents to the physician with a dark discoloration and blisters on his abdomen. What is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms?

Options:
A. Anti-desmoglein antibody formation
B. Deficiency in ADAMTS13 activity
C. Antibody formation against heparin-PF4 complex
D. Antibody-platelet antigen complex formation

Answer: C. Antibody formation against heparin-PF4 complex

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of dark discoloration and blisters on the abdomen are consistent with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition characterized by the destruction of red blood cells and the formation of thrombi in small vessels. The patient's history of recent knee surgery and current medications, including simvastatin, aspirin, and low molecular weight heparin, increase the likelihood that the HUS is caused by antibody formation against the heparin-PF4 complex. This is a known complication of heparin therapy, and the patient's low platelet count supports this diagnosis. Anti-desmoglein antibody formation, deficiency in ADAMTS13 activity, and antibody-platelet antigen complex formation are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms."

582,"Question: A 10-day-old boy presents to the physician with progressively enlarging breasts and a recent onset of white discharge from the left breast. The patient's mother had hypothyroidism during pregnancy and the patient's maternal grandmother died of breast cancer. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?

Options:
A. Reassurance - While the patient's symptoms are concerning, the age of the patient and the lack of any other concerning signs or symptoms suggest that the enlarged breasts are likely due to normal breast development. Reassurance can be provided to the parents that this is a normal and harmless condition.

B. Breast biopsy - A breast biopsy is not necessary at this time as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with any underlying breast pathology. Additionally, the patient is too young for any breast cancer to be present.

C. Serum gonadotropin measurement - Measuring serum gonadotropin levels is not relevant to the management of this patient as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has any underlying endocrine disorders.

D. Chromosomal analysis - Chromosomal analysis is not necessary at this time as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has any underlying genetic disorders.

Answer: A. Reassurance"

His wife notes he's been up all night for several days, but assumed he was handling a big project at work. The patient has no significant medical or psychiatric history. Which treatment is most likely to benefit his condition?

Options:
A. Valproic acid: Given the patient's agitated and disruptive behavior, valproic acid may help manage his symptoms. It is commonly used to treat bipolar disorder and has been shown to have a calming effect on agitation.
B. Antidepressants: Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may help alleviate the patient's agitation and improve his mood. However, it's essential to consider the potential side effects and interactions with other medications.
C. Haloperidol: Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication that can help manage agitation and psychosis. It may be beneficial in this situation, but it's crucial to consider the potential side effects and the patient's risk of tardive dyskinesia.
D. Clozapine: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that can help manage agitation and psychosis. However, it requires close monitoring due to the risk of adverse effects, such as agranulocytosis and orthostatic hypotension.

586,"Question: A 57-year-old woman presents to the physician with a 3-month history of easy fatigability and dyspnea on exertion. Menopause occurred 5 years ago. Her pulse is 105/min and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals pallor of the nail beds and conjunctivae. A peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells. Which of the following additional evaluations is most likely to reveal the underlying cause of her symptoms?

A. Dry bone marrow tap: This option is not likely to provide valuable information in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not indicative of bone marrow dysfunction.

B. Decreased serum haptoglobin concentration: Haptoglobin is a protein that helps to protect red blood cells from hemolysis. A decrease in serum haptoglobin concentration can indicate hemolytic anemia, which could be a possible cause of the patient's symptoms. However, the presence of small, pale red blood cells on the peripheral blood smear suggests that the anemia is not severe enough to cause significant hemolysis.

C. Positive stool guaiac test: A positive stool guaiac test indicates the presence of hemoglobin in the stool, which is a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's symptoms of easy fatigability and dyspnea on exertion could be caused by anemia, which is a common complication of gastrointestinal bleeding.

D. Increased serum methylmalonic acid concentration: Methylmalonic acid is a metabolite that is produced when methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of amino acids, is deficient or dysfunctional. Elevated serum methylmalonic acid concentrations can indicate a metabolic disorder, such as methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency, which can cause anemia, fatigue, and other symptoms. However, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding, which are more likely causes of her symptoms.

Answer: C. Positive stool guaiac test."

She has also spent all of her savings on online shopping and lottery tickets. She has no history of psychiatric illness or substance abuse, and takes no medications. During the examination, she is uncooperative, combative, and refusing care. She screams, “Let me go, God has a plan for me and I must go finish it!” Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 75/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she describes her mood as “amazing.” She has a labile affect, speaks rapidly, and her thought process is tangential. She denies having any hallucinations. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?

A. Haloperidol: Given the patient's agitated and combative behavior, haloperidol would be a reasonable initial choice for pharmacotherapy. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication that can help to calm agitation and aggression, and it is often used in the emergency department setting for patients with acute psychotic episodes.

B. Lithium: Lithium is a mood stabilizer that can be used to treat acute mania and psychosis. However, the patient's history of spending all of her savings on online shopping and lottery tickets, as well as her labile affect and tangential thought process, suggest that she may have a mood disorder rather than a psychotic disorder. Therefore, lithium may not be the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy.

C. Valproate: Valproate is another mood stabilizer that can be used to treat acute mania and psychosis. However, like lithium, the patient's history and presentation suggest that she may have a mood disorder rather than a psychotic disorder. Therefore, valproate may not be the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy.

D. Sertraline: Sertraline is an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that can be used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. While the patient's presentation does suggest some elements of depression, such as her recent loss of sleep and spending spree, the patient's agitated and combative behavior suggest that she may require a different medication than an SSRI.

In summary, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient would be haloperidol."
590,"Question: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents several weeks after the family immigrated from Russia. The parents are worried because the child appears to have trouble seeing and has not started walking. The child was born at home and has never been evaluated by a physician. During the pregnancy, the mother had a week of fever, myalgia, diffuse rash, and bilateral nontender cervical adenopathy after the family adopted a new cat. An MRI of the head is shown. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?

Options:
A. Continuous machinery murmur - This is unlikely in this patient as there is no mention of any heart defects or abnormal heart sounds on the MRI.
B. Spasticity of bilateral lower extremities - Given the mother's history of fever, myalgia, and diffuse rash during pregnancy, it is possible that the child may have developed cerebral palsy, which can cause spasticity of the bilateral lower extremities.
C. Tuft of hair over the lumbosacral area - There is no mention of any abnormal hair growth in the patient's history or on the MRI image.
D. Loss of pain sensation in shawl distribution - There is no mention of any loss of pain sensation in the patient's history or on the MRI image.

Answer: B. Spasticity of bilateral lower extremities."
591,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 51-year-old man is rushed to the emergency room in severe respiratory distress after a chemical spill in his lab. His respiratory rate is 42/min and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. He's unable to speak due to coughing and is using accessory muscles with inspiration. A pulmonary exam reveals bilateral wheezes. He's given multiple nebulizer treatments of albuterol and started on IV methylprednisolone. After 2 treatments, his arterial blood gas test shows pH 7.36, PCO2 41 mm Hg, and PO2 79 mm Hg. What's the best next step in this patient's management?

Options:
A. Administer IV prednisone in addition to IV methylprednisolone
B. Continue to administer albuterol
C. Switch from nebulized albuterol to nebulized ipratropium
D. Intubate the patient and begin mechanical ventilation

Answer: B. Continue to administer albuterol. The patient's response to the initial nebulizer treatment suggests that his symptoms are likely related to bronchospasm, which can be managed with additional doses of albuterol. Administering IV prednisone may provide additional systemic corticosteroid coverage, but it may not be necessary at this point in the patient's management. Switching to nebulized ipratropium may be considered if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, but it's not the best option at this time. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary if the patient's respiratory distress worsens or if he becomes unstable, but it's not the best next step in this patient's management."
592,"Sure! Here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 25-year-old man presents with a nodule on his right foot. He reports that the nodule first appeared last week and has not changed in size or color since then. He denies any history of trauma or fever. His medical history includes HIV, diagnosed 6 years ago, but he is currently not on antiretroviral therapy. His last CD4+ T cell count was 0.19 x 109/L. He is afebrile and vital signs are normal. On physical examination, a 3 cm x 4 cm nodule on the right foot is observed, tan brown in color, non-tender, and covered with a fine scale. A biopsy of the nodule is performed, revealing proliferation of blood vessels with overgrown endothelial cells, and histological staining of the biopsy tissue shows gram-negative bacilli. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?

A. Cefazolin
B. Penicillin
C. Erythromycin
D. Interferon-α

Answer: C. Erythromycin"
593,"Question: A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with central chest pain for the last hour, rating his pain as 8/10, dull in character, associated with profuse sweating and shortness of breath. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, and is currently taking amlodipine, aspirin, atorvastatin, insulin, valsartan, and esomeprazole. Physical examination reveals normal lungs, blood pressure 94/68 mm Hg, pulse 112/min, oxygen saturation 95% on room air, and BMI 31.8 kg/m2. An ECG is done and shows normal sinus rhythm with Q waves in the inferior leads. The patient is discharged home after 3 days on aspirin, clopidogrel, and atenolol, and is advised to get an exercise tolerance test (ETT) in one month. A month later, the patient's resting blood pressure is 145/86 mm Hg, and the pre-exercise ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with Q waves in the inferior leads. After 3 minutes of exercise, the patient develops chest pain that is gradually worsening, and repeat blood pressure is 121/62 mm Hg. No ischemic changes are noted on the ECG. What is the most appropriate next step?

A. Continue exercise since ECG does not show ischemic changes
B. Repeat exercise tolerance testing after one month
C. Stop exercise and order a coronary angiography
D. Stop exercise and order a pharmacological stress test

Answer: C. Stop exercise and order a coronary angiography

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of central chest pain, associated with profuse sweating and shortness of breath, along with the ECG findings of Q waves in the inferior leads, suggest the possibility of an acute coronary event. Given the patient's history of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, as well as his recent onset of chest pain, it is important to rule out significant coronary artery disease. Coronary angiography is the most appropriate next step to evaluate the patient's coronary arteries and determine the cause of his symptoms. The other options are not as appropriate, as they do not address the urgent need to evaluate the patient's coronary artery disease."
594,"Question: Two days after hospital admission and surgical treatment for a cut on his right thigh from a sickle, a 35-year-old man has fever, chills, and intense pain. The wound is swollen. He had a similar injury 4 months ago that resolved following treatment with bacitracin ointment and daily dressings. He works on a farm on the outskirts of the city. He appears anxious. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 103/min, and blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg. Examination shows a 6-cm edematous deep, foul-smelling wound on the medial surface of the right thigh. The skin over the thigh appears darker than the skin on the lower leg. There are multiple blisters around the wound. Light palpation around the wound causes severe pain; crepitus is present. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?

Options:

A. Clostridium perfringens - This bacterium is commonly found in soil and the gastrointestinal tract of animals, and can cause gas gangrene, a severe infection that can lead to tissue death. The patient's history of working on a farm and the presence of multiple blisters around the wound suggest the possibility of Clostridium perfringens infection.

B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa - This bacterium is commonly found in water and can cause skin infections, particularly in warm, moist environments. The patient's history of a similar injury 4 months ago and the presence of a swollen, foul-smelling wound suggest the possibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.

C. Rhizopus oryzae - This fungus is commonly found in soil and can cause skin infections, particularly in warm, moist environments. The patient's history of working on a farm and the presence of multiple blisters around the wound suggest the possibility of Rhizopus oryzae infection.

D. Staphylococcus aureus - This bacterium is commonly found on the skin and in the noses of healthy individuals, but can cause skin infections, particularly in warm, moist environments. The patient's history of a similar injury 4 months ago and the presence of a swollen, foul-smelling wound suggest the possibility of Staphylococcus aureus infection.

Answer: A. Clostridium perfringens"
595,"Question: A 34-year-old man presents to the outpatient clinic with a complaint of right-sided jaw pain. The onset of pain was approximately one month ago and he experiences symptoms 2-3 times a day, with each episode lasting around 30 seconds. He describes the pain as severe (9/10) with an electric and sharp quality. He denies having tear production or conjunctival injection on the affected side during attacks. What is the mechanism of action for the drug that will best treat this patient's condition?

Options:

A. Prevention of Na+ influx: This option is correct. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a trigeminal neuralgia attack, which is caused by an excessive influx of sodium ions into the nerve fibers of the trigeminal nerve. Preventing this influx can help alleviate the pain.

B. Decrease the excitatory effects of glutamic acid: Glutamic acid is an excitatory neurotransmitter that can exacerbate the pain in trigeminal neuralgia. However, this option is not the best choice for treating the patient's condition.

C. Increase the frequency of Cl- channel opening: Cl- channels are important for regulating the flow of chloride ions in the nerve fibers of the trigeminal nerve. Increasing the frequency of Cl- channel opening can help reduce the influx of sodium ions and alleviate the pain. However, this option is not the best choice for treating the patient's condition.

D. Increase the time of Cl- channel opening: Similar to option C, increasing the time of Cl- channel opening can also help reduce the influx of sodium ions and alleviate the pain. However, this option is not the best choice for treating the patient's condition.

Answer: A. Prevention of Na+ influx"
596,"Question: An 83-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, multiple ischemic strokes, and early dementia is found unresponsive in her apartment at her retirement community. She is believed to have not refilled any of her medications for a month, and it is determined that she passed away from a stroke nearly 2 weeks ago. The family is adamant that she receive an autopsy. Which of the following findings are most likely on brain histology?

Options:

A. Cellular debris and lymphocytes
B. Cystic cavitation
C. Fat saponification
D. Increased binding of acidophilic dyes

Answer: B. Cystic cavitation

Explanation:

The passage of time since the woman's death, combined with the lack of medication refill, suggests that the brain has undergone significant degeneration. Cystic cavitation is a common finding in the brains of individuals who have died from stroke, particularly in the areas affected by the stroke. This occurs when the blood supply to the brain is disrupted, leading to the formation of cysts and cavities in the affected tissue.

Option A, cellular debris and lymphocytes, is a common finding in the brains of individuals who have died from any cause, including stroke. However, the presence of cystic cavitation in the brain is more specific to stroke and is likely to be observed in the woman's brain histology.

Option C, fat saponification, is not a likely finding in the brain histology of an individual who has died from stroke. Fat saponification occurs when the brain tissue is exposed to water, leading to the breakdown of lipids and the formation of soapy-like substances. This is not typically observed in the brain of an individual who has died from stroke.

Option D, increased binding of acidophilic dyes, is a possible finding in the brain histology of an individual who has died from stroke, particularly in the areas affected by the stroke. However, the presence of cystic cavitation in the brain is more specific to this diagnosis."
597,"Question: A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe epigastric pain that began an hour prior to presentation. He describes the pain as sharp, 10/10 in severity, and radiating to the back. Swallowing worsens the pain and causes him to cough. Before the pain started, he had been vomiting multiple times per day for the past week. The emesis was yellow and he denied ever seeing blood. Medical history is significant for poorly controlled hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol use disorder, and 2 prior hospitalizations for acute pancreatitis. He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the last 35 years, denies illicit drug use, and drinks 3 pints of vodka per day. On physical exam, there is mediastinal crackling in synchrony with cardiac contraction on cardiac auscultation in the left lateral decubitus position. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient’s symptoms?

A. Coronary artery occlusion: The patient's history of hypertension, smoking, and alcohol use disorder increase the likelihood of coronary artery disease as a cause of his symptoms. However, the patient's recent onset of severe epigastric pain and radiating back pain, along with the mediastinal crackling heard on cardiac auscultation, suggest a more urgent and potentially life-threatening condition such as transmural esophageal rupture.

B. Dissection of the aorta: While the patient's history of hypertension and smoking may increase the risk of aortic dissection, the patient's recent onset of severe epigastric pain and radiating back pain, along with the mediastinal crackling heard on cardiac auscultation, suggest a more urgent and potentially life-threatening condition such as transmural esophageal rupture.

C. Ulcerative changes in the gastric mucosa: The patient's history of chronic vomiting and alcohol use disorder increase the likelihood of gastric ulcers as a cause of his symptoms. However, the patient's recent onset of severe epigastric pain and radiating back pain, along with the mediastinal crackling heard on cardiac auscultation, suggest a more urgent and potentially life-threatening condition such as transmural esophageal rupture.

D. Transmural esophageal rupture: The patient's recent onset of severe epigastric pain and radiating back pain, along with the mediastinal crackling heard on cardiac auscultation, suggest a transmural esophageal rupture as the most likely cause of his symptoms. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgical intervention."
598,"Question: A 34-year-old woman presents to the physician with fever, sore throat, generalized body pain, and fatigue for 2 days. She has a history of Graves' disease and was recently switched from methimazole to PTU due to arthralgias and rash. Examination reveals a 1 cm ulcer on the side of the tongue and surrounding erythema. Which diagnostic study is the most important at this time?

Options:
A. Complete blood count with differential
B. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
C. Thyroid-stimulating hormone
D. No further testing is indicated

Answer: A. Complete blood count with differential

Rationale: Given the patient's symptoms of fever, sore throat, and generalized body pain, as well as the recent switch from methimazole to PTU, it is important to assess for potential side effects or complications of the medication. A complete blood count with differential can help identify any abnormalities in the patient's white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection or inflammation. Additionally, the patient's history of Graves' disease and recent switch to PTU may affect her thyroid function, and a complete blood count with differential can help monitor any changes in her thyroid levels."
599,"Question: A 51-year-old woman with Sjogren's syndrome presents to her physician for suddenly developed palpitations, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight loss, diarrhea, and a feeling of a racing heart. She has a history of Sjogren's syndrome, which is an autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands, including the thyroid gland. On physical examination, her skin appears warm and moist, her reflexes are hyperactive, and her thyroid gland is moderately enlarged and non-tender. Her blood pressure is 136/88 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, respirations are 17/min, and temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F). Which of the following pathologic findings is this patient likely to have?

A. Silent thyroiditis: This is a rare condition where the thyroid gland becomes inflamed, but there are no symptoms or abnormalities detected on physical examination or laboratory tests. As the patient is experiencing symptoms such as palpitations, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping, and has a history of Sjogren's syndrome, it is unlikely that she has silent thyroiditis.

B. Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis: This is an inflammatory condition that affects the thyroid gland, causing it to become enlarged and nodular. The patient's symptoms of palpitations, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping, as well as the physical examination findings of a moderately enlarged and non-tender thyroid gland, are consistent with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.

C. Granulomatous thyroiditis: This is a rare condition that occurs when the thyroid gland becomes inflamed and forms granulomas, which are small clusters of immune cells. The patient's symptoms of palpitations, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping, as well as the physical examination finding of a moderately enlarged and non-tender thyroid gland, are not consistent with granulomatous thyroiditis.

D. Fibrous thyroiditis: This is a rare condition that occurs when the thyroid gland becomes inflamed and scarred, leading to a hard, fibrous nodule that can form in the gland. The patient's symptoms of palpitations, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping, as well as the physical examination finding of a moderately enlarged and non-tender thyroid gland, are not consistent with fibrous thyroiditis.

Answer: B. Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis."
600,"Question: A 75-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of persistent back pain and fatigue. Which of the following would be the most likely finding on peripheral blood smear?

Options:

A. Atypical lymphocytes
B. Rouleaux formation
C. Schistocytes
D. Target cells

Answer: B. Rouleaux formation

Rationale: Rouleaux formation is the most likely finding on peripheral blood smear in this patient's case. Rouleaux formation is a condition where red blood cells clump together in a irregular pattern, often seen in dehydration, hypovolemia, or electrolyte imbalances. The patient's recent weight loss and fatigue, as well as the presence of cardiovascular murmur and crackles on lung exam, suggest that the patient may have an underlying electrolyte imbalance or dehydration, which could lead to Rouleaux formation on the peripheral blood smear. Atypical lymphocytes, schistocytes, and target cells are less likely findings in this scenario."
601,"Question: A 25-year-old woman presents to the physician with sudden blindness in her right eye, which has been accompanied by significant stress due to relationship problems with her partner. She has a history of major depressive disorder treated with fluoxetine, but does not smoke or drink alcohol, and does not use illicit drugs. She appears anxious and her vital signs are within normal limits. The ophthalmologic examination reveals a normal-appearing eye with no redness, and slit lamp and fundoscopy show no abnormalities. A visual field test shows nonspecific visual field defects, and an MRI of the brain shows no abnormalities. Based on this information, the most likely diagnosis is:

A. Malingering: This option is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a psychological disorder rather than a deliberate attempt to deceive.

B. Retinal detachment: This option is also unlikely, as the patient's ophthalmologic examination reveals a normal-appearing eye with no redness, and slit lamp and fundoscopy show no abnormalities.

C. Somatic symptom disorder: This option is more likely, as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a psychological disorder related to stress and anxiety.

D. Conversion disorder: This option is the most likely diagnosis, as the patient's sudden blindness in her right eye is likely a psychological response to the significant stress she is experiencing due to relationship problems. Conversion disorder is a psychological condition in which a person experiences physical symptoms, such as blindness, as a result of emotional distress."
602,"Question: A 17-year-old male presents to the physician with painful genital sores, malaise, and fever for 3 days. He is sexually active with 3 female partners and does not use condoms consistently. His temperature is 38.3°C (101°F). Physical examination reveals tender lymphadenopathy in the left inguinal region and multiple, punched-out ulcers over the penile shaft and glans. Which of the following microscopic findings is most likely to be seen on smear examination of a sample from one of these ulcers?

A. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions
B. Basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions
C. Eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions
D. Basophilic intranuclear inclusions

Answer: A. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions"
603,"Question: A 22-year-old man volunteers for a research study on lung function. He has no history of lung disease or allergies and does not smoke. His pulmonary blood flow is measured in the various labeled segments of the lungs while standing. Then the volunteer, still standing, is given very low continuous positive airway pressure and the blood flow measured again. Which of the following sets of findings are most likely to be present in the second measurements relative to the first?

Options:

A. Reduced blood flow in zone 1: This is the most likely option, as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can cause blood vessels in the lungs to constrict, leading to reduced blood flow in zone 1.

B. Increased blood flow in zone 1: This option is unlikely, as CPAP typically causes blood vessels to constrict, rather than dilate.

C. Reduced blood flow in zone 3: This option is also unlikely, as there is no evidence to suggest that CPAP would cause a reduction in blood flow in zone 3.

D. Increased blood flow in zone 3: This option is the least likely, as there is no evidence to suggest that CPAP would cause an increase in blood flow in zone 3.

Answer: A. Reduced blood flow in zone 1."
604,"Question: A 50-year-old man with a history of stage 4 kidney disease and severe diverticulitis is admitted to the hospital for an elective hemicolectomy. After the procedure, he becomes septic and is placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics. On morning rounds, he appears weak, complains of fatigue and nausea, and has difficulty answering questions. His temperature is 38.9°C (102.1°C), heart rate is 110/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg, and saturation is 89% on room air. On physical exam, his mental status appears altered, and he has a bruise on his left arm that spontaneously appeared overnight. His cardiac exam is positive for a weak friction rub. Blood specimens are collected and sent for evaluation. An ECG is performed (see image). What therapy will this patient most likely receive next?

A. Perform a STAT pericardiocentesis: Pericardiocentesis is a procedure that involves inserting a needle into the pericardial space surrounding the heart to drain excess fluid. However, in this patient's case, it is unlikely that pericardiocentesis would be performed as a first line of treatment, given his altered mental status and the presence of a bruise on his left arm.

B. Treat the patient with cyclophosphamide and prednisone: Cyclophosphamide and prednisone are medications that are commonly used to treat sepsis and inflammation. However, in this patient's case, the presence of a weak friction rub on cardiac exam suggests that there may be some cardiac involvement, which would require further evaluation and management before initiating immunosuppressive therapy.

C. Send the patient for hemodialysis: Hemodialysis is a treatment option for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) who have a significant decline in kidney function. In this patient's case, his history of stage 4 kidney disease and the presence of septicemia suggest that he may have developed AKI, which could benefit from hemodialysis.

D. Prepare the patient for renal transplant: Renal transplant is a surgical procedure that involves replacing a diseased kidney with a healthy donor kidney. However, in this patient's case, he has a history of stage 4 kidney disease and is already on dialysis, which suggests that he may not be a good candidate for renal transplant.

Answer: C. Send the patient for hemodialysis."
605,"Question: A 24-year-old graduate student is brought to the emergency department by her boyfriend due to chest pain that started 90 minutes ago. Her boyfriend reports that she has been taking medication to help her study for an important exam and has not slept in several days. On examination, she is diaphoretic, agitated, and attempts to remove her IV lines and ECG leads. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 128/min, and blood pressure is 163/97 mmHg. Her pupils are dilated. The most appropriate next step in management is the administration of which of the following?

A. Dantrolene: Dantrolene is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. Dantrolene is used to treat malignant hyperthermia, a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by rapid heart rate, high body temperature, and muscle rigidity. The patient's symptoms do not suggest malignant hyperthermia, and dantrolene would not be effective in managing her agitation or attempting to remove her IV lines and ECG leads.

B. Activated charcoal: Activated charcoal is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. Activated charcoal is used to treat poisoning or overdose, but the patient's symptoms do not suggest poisoning or overdose.

C. Ketamine: Ketamine is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that can help manage agitation and aggression. It can also help sedate the patient and allow for easier removal of the IV lines and ECG leads.

D. Lorazepam: Lorazepam is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that can help manage agitation and aggression. It can also help sedate the patient and allow for easier removal of the IV lines and ECG leads.

Answer: D. Lorazepam"
606,"Question: A 60-year-old man presents with severe chronic neck pain that has persisted for 6 months following a whiplash injury in a motor vehicle accident. Despite previous treatment with cyclobenzaprine and tramadol, the patient's pain remains unrelenting, affecting his sleep and daily life. He expresses feelings of hopelessness and considers suicide as an option. What is the most appropriate initial course of action for this patient?

Options:
A. Immediate admission to the hospital for close monitoring and further evaluation
B. Outpatient pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy with a focus on pain management and suicide prevention
C. Outpatient psychotherapy alone to address the patient's emotional distress and suicidal ideation
D. Collaboration with local law enforcement to confiscate the patient's gun and ensure his safety

Answer: A. Admission into the hospital

Rationale: Given the patient's severe and persistent pain, as well as his suicidal ideation, it is crucial to provide close monitoring and further evaluation to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to his symptoms. Hospital admission will allow for more comprehensive assessment and management of the patient's pain, as well as psychological support and suicide prevention measures. Outpatient treatment options may not be sufficient to address the patient's complex needs in this case."
607,"Question: A 13-year-old Caucasian male presents with his father to the pediatrician's office complaining of left lower thigh pain. He reports slowly progressive pain over the distal aspect of his left thigh over the past three months. He denies any recent trauma to the area. His temperature is 100.9°F (38.3°C). On exam, there is swelling and tenderness overlying the inferior aspect of the left femoral diaphysis. Laboratory evaluation is notable for an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Biopsy of the lesion demonstrates sheets of monotonous small round blue cells with minimal cytoplasm. He is diagnosed and started on a medication that inhibits transcription by intercalating into DNA at the transcription initiation complex. Which of the following adverse events will this patient be at highest risk for following initiation of this medication?

A. Pulmonary fibrosis
B. Peripheral neuropathy
C. Hemorrhagic cystitis
D. Bone marrow suppression

Answer: D. Bone marrow suppression

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of swelling and tenderness over the inferior aspect of the left femoral diaphysis, along with the biopsy results showing sheets of monotonous small round blue cells with minimal cytoplasm, are consistent with a diagnosis of a bone tumor, such as osteosarcoma. The medication the patient is started on, which inhibits transcription by intercalating into DNA at the transcription initiation complex, can cause bone marrow suppression as a potential adverse event. Bone marrow suppression can lead to a decrease in the production of blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, which can cause anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Therefore, the patient is at highest risk for bone marrow suppression following initiation of this medication."
608,"Question: A 3-week-old neonate in the NICU has bilious vomiting. What is the most likely finding in this patient?

Options:
A. Diffuse microcolon on barium enema
B. No air in the rectum on abdominal X-ray
C. Air in the bowel wall on abdominal X-ray
D. Epigastric olive-shaped mass on abdominal sonography

Answer: C. Air in the bowel wall on abdominal X-ray.

The patient's symptoms of bilious vomiting and abdominal distension, along with the laboratory findings of metabolic acidosis, suggest that the neonate has a bowel obstruction or perforation. The abdominal X-ray will likely reveal air in the bowel wall, which confirms the diagnosis. Diffuse microcolon on barium enema and epigastric olive-shaped mass on abdominal sonography are less likely findings in this patient, as they are not consistent with a bowel obstruction or perforation. No air in the rectum on abdominal X-ray is also not a diagnostic finding in this case, as it could indicate a different underlying condition."
609,"Question: A 28-year-old soldier is brought to a military treatment facility 45 minutes after sustaining injuries in a building fire from a mortar attack. He was trapped inside the building for around 20 minutes. On arrival, he is confused and appears uncomfortable. He has a Glasgow Coma Score of 13. His pulse is 113/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Examination shows multiple second-degree burns over the chest and bilateral upper extremities, and third-degree burns over the face. There are black sediments seen within the nose and mouth. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Insertion of nasogastric tube and enteral nutrition: While the patient is receiving intravenous fluid resuscitation, insertion of a nasogastric tube and enteral nutrition may be considered once the patient's airway is stable and they are able to tolerate oral intake. However, given the patient's significant burns and respiratory distress, intubation and mechanical ventilation are the most appropriate next step in management to ensure adequate oxygenation and to prevent respiratory failure.

B. Intravenous antibiotic therapy: Intravenous antibiotics may be considered once the patient's airway is stable and they are able to tolerate medication. However, in this case, the patient's respiratory distress and burns are the primary concerns, and intubation and mechanical ventilation are the most appropriate next step in management.

C. Intubation and mechanical ventilation: Given the patient's significant burns and respiratory distress, intubation and mechanical ventilation are the most appropriate next step in management to ensure adequate oxygenation and to prevent respiratory failure.

D. Intravenous corticosteroid therapy: Intravenous corticosteroids may be considered once the patient's airway is stable and they are able to tolerate medication. However, in this case, the patient's respiratory distress and burns are the primary concerns, and intubation and mechanical ventilation are the most appropriate next step in management."

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Topical erythromycin: Incorrect. While erythromycin is an antibiotic that can be effective against some bacterial infections, it is not the most appropriate treatment for a fungal infection such as this.

B. Phototherapy: Incorrect. Phototherapy is a treatment that involves exposure to specific wavelengths of light to help manage certain skin conditions, but it is not necessary for this case.

C. Topical miconazole: Correct. Miconazole is an over-the-counter antifungal medication that is commonly used to treat fungal infections such as this. It is applied directly to the affected area and can help to relieve itching and reduce the size of the rash.

D. Topical hydrocortisone: Incorrect. Hydrocortisone is a steroid medication that can help to reduce inflammation, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for a fungal infection such as this.

Answer: C. Topical miconazole."
611,"Question: A 33-year-old man presents to the physician with a 4-month history of decreased hearing in his right ear, accompanied by multiple episodes of dizziness and a constant ringing noise in his right ear. Over the past 5 weeks, he has also noticed scant amounts of right-sided ear discharge. He has a history of multiple ear infections since childhood that were treated with antibiotics. Vital signs are within normal limits. Otoscopic examination reveals a white pearly mass behind the right tympanic membrane. When a 512 Hz tuning fork is placed in the center of the forehead, it shows lateralization to the right ear. Which of the following treatments is most appropriate for this patient's symptoms?

A. Topical ciprofloxacin: This antibiotic is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those that can cause middle ear infections. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms suggest a more severe condition, such as a cholesteatoma or an acoustic neuroma, which may not be treated effectively with topical antibiotics alone.

B. Systemic corticosteroids: Corticosteroids can help reduce inflammation in the middle ear and alleviate symptoms such as dizziness and hearing loss. However, they may not address the underlying cause of the condition, and their use may have potential side effects, such as weight gain, mood changes, and increased risk of infections.

C. Fitting for hearing aids: Hearing aids can help improve the patient's hearing and quality of life, but they will not address the underlying cause of the hearing loss.

D. Surgical excision: Surgical removal of the white pearly mass or any other abnormality in the middle ear may be necessary to treat the patient's symptoms. This option is the most appropriate choice as it directly addresses the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Answer: D. Surgical excision."
612,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A medical research study is launching to evaluate the positive predictive value of a novel blood test for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The diagnostic group comprises 700 patients with NHL, of which 400 tested positive for the novel blood test. In contrast, the control group consists of 700 age-matched control patients, none of whom tested positive for the novel test. What is the PPV of this test?

Options:
A. Divide the number of patients in the diagnostic group who tested positive for the novel test by the total number of patients in the diagnostic group (700 / 700 = 1).
B. Divide the number of patients in the diagnostic group who tested positive for the novel test by the total number of patients in the diagnostic group, excluding those who tested negative (700 / (400 + 0) = 1.71).
C. Divide the number of patients in the control group who tested negative for the novel test by the total number of patients in the control group (400 / (400 + 300) = 0.71).
D. Divide the number of patients in the diagnostic group who tested positive for the novel test by the total number of patients in the diagnostic group, excluding those who tested positive (400 / (400 + 0) = 1).

Answer: D. 400 / (400 + 0)"

Answer: C. Increased deep tendon reflexes."
614,"Question: A 38-year-old woman presents to the physician with a 3-month history of moderate abdominal pain that has been resistant to medication. She has a history of two spontaneous abortions at 11 and 12 weeks' gestation. Abdominal ultrasound reveals normal liver parenchyma, a dilated portal vein, and enlarged spleen. Upper endoscopy shows dilated submucosal veins in the lower esophagus. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be detected during further evaluation of this patient?

A. Elevated prothrombin time
B. Congestion in the hepatic veins
C. Presence of Councilman bodies
D. Thrombocytopenia

Answer: D. Thrombocytopenia"
615,"Question: A 55-year-old patient who immigrated from the Middle East to the United States 10 years ago presents to the emergency department due to excessive weakness, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss over the past 10 months. He has had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years and takes metformin. He underwent an appendectomy 12 years ago in his home country and had an uncomplicated postoperative course. He denies smoking and drinks alcohol socially. His blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 75/min, and temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F). On physical examination, the patient appears exhausted, and his sclerae are yellowish. A firm mass is palpated in the right upper abdominal quadrant. Abdominal ultrasonography shows liver surface nodularity, splenomegaly, and increased diameter of the portal vein. Which of the following is the most likely complication of this patient's condition?

A. Hepatic encephalopathy
B. Hepatorenal syndrome
C. Hepatopulmonary syndrome
D. Ascites

Answer: D. Ascites

Rationale: The patient's presentation of excessive weakness, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss, along with the findings of liver surface nodularity, splenomegaly, and increased diameter of the portal vein on abdominal ultrasonography, are consistent with the diagnosis of cirrhosis. Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis, which can lead to respiratory distress, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatopulmonary syndrome are less likely complications in this patient given his presentation and laboratory findings."
616,"Question: A 53-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for confusion. He was in his usual state of health until about 3 hours ago when he tried to use his sandwich to turn off the TV. He also complained to his wife that he had a severe headache. Past medical history is notable for hypertension, which has been difficult to control on multiple medications. His temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), the pulse is 70/min, and the blood pressure is 206/132 mm Hg. On physical exam he is alert and oriented only to himself, repeating over and over that his head hurts. The physical exam is otherwise unremarkable and his neurologic exam is nonfocal. The noncontrast CT scan of the patient’s head is shown. Which of the following diagnostic tests is likely to reveal the diagnosis for this patient?

A. CT angiography of the brain: This test is unlikely to reveal the diagnosis for this patient, as it is not specific to the brain or head injury.
B. CT angiography of the neck: This test is also unlikely to reveal the diagnosis, as it is not specific to the brain or head injury.
C. Lumbar puncture: This test may be able to diagnose a brain or head injury, but it is not the most likely test to reveal the diagnosis for this patient based on the symptoms and physical exam findings.
D. MRI of the brain: An MRI of the brain is the most likely test to reveal the diagnosis for this patient, as it can provide detailed images of the brain and may show evidence of a head injury or other abnormality.

Answer: D. MRI of the brain"
617,"Question: An 87-year-old man with glioblastoma multiforme is informed that the size and location of the tumor make operative resection impossible, and he has a prognosis of between 3-6 months. The patient then asks whether it would be possible to get a prescription for lethal medications so that he would be able to end his life if his situation deteriorated further. The physician says that he is unable to prescribe such drugs because assisted suicide is not legal in their state. Refusing to help a patient commit suicide is most consistent with which of the following ethical principles?

Options:

A. Autonomy - This principle emphasizes the patient's right to make decisions about their own healthcare, including the right to refuse treatment. However, in this scenario, the physician is not refusing to provide treatment, but rather refusing to assist the patient in ending their life.

B. Distributive justice - This principle concerns the fair distribution of healthcare resources and opportunities. While it may be argued that the patient has a right to access lethal medications, it is also important to consider the potential impact on society as a whole, as well as the ethical implications of expanding access to such medications.

C. Formal justice - This principle focuses on the fairness and impartiality of the healthcare system. While it is important to ensure that patients have access to fair and impartial healthcare, it is also important to consider the ethical implications of providing lethal medications for the purpose of ending a patient's life.

D. Non-maleficence - This principle prohibits healthcare providers from causing harm to their patients. While it may be argued that providing lethal medications could be seen as a way to end suffering, it is also important to consider the potential harm to the patient and their loved ones, as well as the broader ethical implications of such a decision.

Answer: D. Non-maleficence - By refusing to prescribe lethal medications, the physician is avoiding causing harm to the patient and is acting in accordance with the ethical principle of non-maleficence."
618,"Question: A 20-year-old woman presents to the emergency department 6 hours after the onset of severe colicky lower abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. She has a history of stable inflammatory bowel disease treated with 5-aminosalicylic acid and is sexually active with her boyfriend, using condoms inconsistently. She was diagnosed with chlamydia one year ago. Her vital signs are normal, except for a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Urine culture: This is not the most appropriate next step in management, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI).

B. Transvaginal ultrasound: While a transvaginal ultrasound may be useful in evaluating the patient's pelvic organs, it is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's symptoms.

C. CT scan of the abdomen: A CT scan of the abdomen may be useful in evaluating the patient's abdominal organs, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's symptoms.

D. Serum β-hCG concentration: Given the patient's history of chlamydia and inconsistent use of condoms, the most appropriate next step in management is to check the patient's serum β-hCG concentration to rule out the possibility of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is a common complication of chlamydia infection and can lead to serious consequences if left untreated."
619,"Question: A 24-year-old newly immigrated mother seeks advice on breastfeeding options for her newborn child. Due to her recent arrival from Sub-Saharan Africa, further testing is required before she can start breastfeeding. Which of the following infections is an absolute contraindication to breastfeeding?

Options:
A. Hepatitis B
B. Hepatitis C
C. Latent tuberculosis
D. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)

Answer: D. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)

Explanation: HIV is an absolute contraindication to breastfeeding because it can be transmitted through breast milk. The mother's HIV status should be thoroughly evaluated and managed before she starts breastfeeding her child to prevent the risk of transmitting the virus."
620,"Question: A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 1-week history of worsening dyspnea and intermittent chest pain that increases on inspiration. He had an upper respiratory tract infection 2 weeks ago. His pulse is 115/min and blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg. Examination reveals inspiratory crackles bilaterally. His serum troponin I is 0.21 ng/mL (N < 0.1). An x-ray of the chest shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette and prominent vascular markings in both lung fields, with blunted costophrenic angles. A rhythm strip shows inverted T waves. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be present in this patient's condition?

A. Sarcomere duplication
B. Elevated brain natriuretic peptide
C. Opening snap with low-pitched diastolic rumble
D. Electrical alternans

Answer: B. Elevated brain natriuretic peptide

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with acute heart failure, which is characterized by an increase in the levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). BNP is a hormone produced by the heart in response to stretching and pressure overload, and its levels can be elevated in patients with heart failure. In contrast, the other options are less likely to be present in this patient's condition. Sarcomere duplication is a rare genetic condition that can cause cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but it is not typically associated with acute heart failure. Opening snap with low-pitched diastolic rumble is a finding on a cardiac auscultation that can be seen in certain types of cardiomyopathy, but it is not specific to acute heart failure. Electrical alternans is a rare finding that can occur in certain types of cardiac arrhythmias, but it is not typically seen in acute heart failure."
621,"Question: A 42-year-old woman presents with a painful mass on her neck that has grown over the last few days. What is the most appropriate diagnostic study at this time?

Options:
A. Culture for facultative anaerobes
B. Histologic evaluation for Reed-Sternberg cells
C. Toxoplasma IgG using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
D. Warthin-Starry silver stain for Bartonella henselae

Answer: D. Warthin-Starry silver stain for Bartonella henselae

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of a painful mass on her neck that has grown over the last few days, along with the presence of discolored teeth, suggest the possibility of a deep-seated infection such as a bacterial abscess. The Warthin-Starry silver stain is a diagnostic test that can detect the presence of Bartonella henselae, a bacterium that can cause cat-scratch disease, which is a common cause of deep-seated infections in the neck. While the other options may also be relevant, the Warthin-Starry silver stain is the most appropriate diagnostic study at this time given the patient's symptoms and medical history."
622,"Question: A previously healthy 24-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of choking sensation, palpitations, diffuse sweating, and shortness of breath over the past 3 months. These episodes occur without warning and last for about 10 minutes before gradually resolving. Despite twice being evaluated in the emergency department, her ECG showed normal sinus rhythm, and serum cardiac enzymes and thyroid hormone levels were normal. She is concerned about the potential for future episodes and wants to know the next step in management. Vital signs are within normal limits, and physical examination shows no abnormalities. Urine toxicology screening is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Prescribe fluoxetine: As the patient's symptoms are primarily related to anxiety and stress, fluoxetine may be beneficial in managing her symptoms. It is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that can help reduce anxiety and improve mood.

B. D-dimer measurement: D-dimer is a marker of blood clotting and may be elevated in patients with pulmonary embolism, which could be a potential cause of the patient's symptoms. Measuring D-dimer levels may help rule out this diagnosis.

C. Echocardiography: Echocardiography is an imaging test that can provide information on the structure and function of the heart. It may be useful in evaluating the patient's heart function and identifying any potential underlying cardiac causes of her symptoms.

D. Administer lorazepam: Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that can help manage acute anxiety attacks. However, it may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, and it may have potential side effects, so it is not the most appropriate next step in management."
623,"Question: An 8-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother due to concerns about severe abdominal pain, emesis, and ""currant jelly"" stool. After a physical examination and ultrasound, the diagnosis of intussusception is confirmed. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?

Options:

A. Repeat barium enema every 6 hours to monitor for recurrence (D)
B. Keep the patient NPO and initiate work-up to identify the lead point (B)
C. Admit the patient to the hospital for 24-hour observation for complications and/or recurrence (C)
D. Pursue urgent surgical reduction with resection of necrotic segments of bowel (D)

Answer: C. Admit the patient to the hospital for 24-hour observation for complications and/or recurrence.

Rationale: Intussusception is a surgical emergency that requires prompt management to prevent complications such as bowel obstruction, ischemia, and perforation. Given the patient's recent onset of severe abdominal pain, emesis, and ""currant jelly"" stool, it is important to observe the patient closely for any signs of deterioration. Admitting the patient to the hospital for 24 hours will allow for close monitoring and prompt management in case of any complications. Repeating the barium enema every 6 hours (Option A) may not be necessary at this time, as the diagnosis has already been confirmed and the patient is already undergoing observation. Initiating work-up to identify the lead point (Option B) may also not be necessary at this time, as the diagnosis of intussusception has already been confirmed. Pursuing urgent surgical reduction with resection of necrotic segments of bowel (Option D) is not a viable option at this time, as the patient is not yet experiencing any signs of severe bowel ischemia or perforation."
624,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 40-year-old Caucasian woman presents to the physician with persistent urinary frequency, urgency, and pelvic pain lasting one week. She experiences poor sleep quality due to symptoms persisting throughout the night and day. Pain partially subsides with urination, and she does not have dysuria or urinary incontinence. Her menstrual cycles are regular. Over the past six months, she has had several similar episodes, each lasting one to two weeks, with symptom-free periods in between. Her symptoms began six months ago after a diagnosis of cystitis, for which she was treated with appropriate antibiotics. Urine cultures have consistently been negative since then. Her medical history includes fibromyalgia, multiple uterine fibroids, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression. She takes tramadol occasionally and sertraline daily. Vital signs are within normal limits, and the neurological examination reveals no abnormalities. Abdominal, pelvic, and rectal examination findings are unremarkable. Cystoscopy after full distension and drainage reveals small petechial hemorrhages throughout the bladder, excluding the trigone. Which of the following interventions is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A. Amitriptyline
B. Behavior modification
C. Bladder hydrodistension
D. Intravesical dimethyl sulfoxide

Answer: B. Behavior modification"
625,"Question: A 5-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency department after falling on the playground in kindergarten and showing inability to stand on his right leg. His right leg is found to be abnormally bent at the femur, and he is splinted on-site by first responders. His medical history reveals multiple prior fractures in his left humerus and femur. Additionally, his developmental milestones are on track, and he is excelling in kindergarten. During physical examination, the following finding is observed (figure A). Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's multiple fractures?

Options:
A. Decreased collagen hydroxylation
B. Increased adenylyl cyclase activity
C. Mutation in neurofibromin
D. Non-accidental trauma

Answer: B. Increased adenylyl cyclase activity.

Explanation:
The patient's history of multiple prior fractures in his left humerus and femur, particularly in a child of his age, suggests a genetic disorder that affects bone fragility. Increased adenylyl cyclase activity has been linked to several genetic disorders that cause osteogenesis imperfecta, a condition characterized by brittle bones prone to fractures. This is the most likely cause of the patient's multiple fractures, as opposed to decreased collagen hydroxylation, mutation in neurofibromin, or non-accidental trauma."
626,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 70-year-old man presents with progressive dyspnea on minimal exertion. He reports feeling winded when climbing a single flight of stairs, which was not the case 10 years ago. He also experiences shortness of breath when lying down, despite no recent fevers, cough, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. His medical history includes two hospitalizations for ""the shakes"" over the past 10 years, but no heart conditions. He has a 10 pack-year smoking history and currently drinks ""a few"" drinks per night. On examination, his vital signs are normal, but he is mildly obese with an abdominal obesity and a liver edge palpated 2-3 cm below the costal margin. He has 2+ edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show a normal metabolic panel, complete blood count, liver function tests, and coagulation studies, but an elevated sodium level of 130 mEq/L. An EKG reveals signs of left ventricular enlargement with a first-degree AV block. A cardiac catheterization report from 5 years ago shows a moderately enlarged heart but patent coronary arteries. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be causing the patient's symptoms?

A. Toxic cardiomyopathy: This condition is likely caused by exposure to drugs, alcohol, or other toxins, which can damage the heart muscle and lead to progressive dyspnea.
B. Diastolic heart failure: This condition occurs when the heart muscle becomes weakened and cannot effectively pump blood between beats, leading to shortness of breath and fatigue.
C. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: This condition occurs when the heart muscle is damaged due to a lack of oxygen, often caused by coronary artery disease.
D. Nephrotic syndrome: This condition occurs when the kidneys are unable to filter waste products from the blood, leading to fluid retention and swelling in the legs and feet.

Answer: A. Toxic cardiomyopathy"
627,"Question: What is the greatest risk factor for the development of DLBCL in HIV-positive patients, based on the study?

A. Positive family history of cancer
B. Male sex
C. Poor adherence to cART
D. Income below $30,000 per year

Answer: C. Poor adherence to cART.

According to the study, poor adherence to cART was found to be a significant risk factor for the development of DLBCL in HIV-positive patients. The other options are not supported by the study."
628,"Question: A 46-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a lump in her left breast. She reports finding it two months prior and notes that it has not grown significantly since then. She denies nipple discharge or tenderness. On examination, a 3-4 cm rubbery mass is noted in the left breast. Biopsy results show invasive ductal carcinoma that is estrogen receptor positive. Her oncologist prescribes tamoxifen. Which of the following is NOT a potential effect of tamoxifen therapy?

A. Decreased risk of endometrial cancer
B. Increased risk of deep vein thrombosis
C. Decreased risk of osteoporosis
D. Increased risk of ocular toxicity

Answer: A. Decreased risk of endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen has been shown to decrease the risk of endometrial cancer in women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, but it does not decrease the risk of endometrial cancer in general. The other options are potential side effects of tamoxifen therapy."
629,"Question: A 27-year-old nulligravid woman seeks medical evaluation for infertility. She has been unable to conceive for one year despite regular intercourse with her husband 1-2 times per week. Semen analysis revealed a normal sperm count for her husband. Two years ago, she experienced a brief episode of fever and lower abdominal pain, which resolved without treatment. Menarche began at age 12, and menstrual cycles are regular, lasting 4-5 days. Prior to marriage, she was sexually active with four male partners and used a combined oral contraceptive pill with estrogen and progesterone consistently, as well as inconsistent barrier protection. One year ago, she discontinued the oral contraceptive pill to facilitate pregnancy. She stands at 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb), resulting in a BMI of 30.8 kg/m2. A thorough physical examination reveals no abnormalities. Based on this information, which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient's infertility?

A. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
B. Prolonged use of the oral contraceptive pill
C. Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)
D. Tubal scarring

Answer: D. Tubal scarring

Explanation:

The patient's history of irregular menstrual cycles, despite regular intercourse, suggests that she may have a tubal factor contributing to her infertility. The patient's history of long-term use of the oral contraceptive pill may also contribute to tubal damage, as well as her previous episodes of fever and lower abdominal pain, which could be indicative of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a common cause of tubal damage. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is less likely, given the patient's regular menstrual cycles and normal sperm count for her husband. Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is also unlikely, as the patient is still within the normal age range for menopause. Tubal scarring is the most likely explanation for the patient's infertility, as it can cause obstruction or damage to the fallopian tubes, making it difficult for the sperm to reach the egg."
630,"Question: A 6-year-old girl is referred to the pediatrician after a primary care practitioner found her to be anemic, in addition to presenting with decreased bowel movements, intermittent abdominal pain, and hearing loss. The child has also shown poor performance at school and has lost interest in continuing her classes of glazed pottery that she has taken twice a week for the past year. During the examination, the pediatrician identifies gingival lines, generalized pallor, and moderate abdominal pain. Laboratory tests show elevated iron and ferritin concentration, and a blood smear shows small and hypochromic erythrocytes, basophilic stippling, and the presence of nucleated erythroblasts with granules visualized with Prussian blue. Which of the following molecules cannot be produced in the erythrocytes of this patient?

A. Aminolevulinic acid
B. Hydroxymethylbilane
C. Porphobilinogen
D. Protoporphyrin

Answer: C. Porphobilinogen

Explanation: Porphobilinogen is a molecule that is not produced in the erythrocytes of patients with iron deficiency anemia. The other options, aminolevulinic acid, hydroxymethylbilane, and protoporphyrin, are all molecules that are produced in the erythrocytes of patients with iron deficiency anemia."
631,"Question: A 57-year-old HIV-positive male with a history of intravenous drug abuse presents to the emergency room complaining of arm swelling. He reports that he developed progressively worsening swelling and tenderness over the right antecubital fossa three days prior. He recently returned from a trip to Nicaragua. His past medical history is notable for an anaphylactoid reaction to vancomycin. His temperature is 101.4°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 140/70 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination reveals an erythematous, fluctuant, and tender mass overlying the right antecubital fossa. Multiple injection marks are noted across both upper extremities. He undergoes incision and drainage and is started on an antibiotic that targets the 50S ribosome. He is discharged with plans to follow up in one week. However, five days later he presents to the same emergency room complaining of abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea.

Options:

A. Gram-negative curved bacillus - This is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's current symptoms, as the patient has a history of intravenous drug abuse and the injection marks on his arms suggest that he may have developed an infection related to his drug use.

B. Gram-negative bacillus - This is also unlikely, as the patient's recent travel history to Nicaragua may have exposed him to a Gram-negative bacillus, but the patient's symptoms of abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea are more consistent with a different type of infection.

C. Gram-positive coccus - This is a possibility, as the patient's recent travel history and injection drug use may have exposed him to a Gram-positive coccus. However, the patient's current symptoms of abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea are more consistent with a different type of infection.

D. Gram-positive bacillus - This is the most likely cause of the patient's current symptoms, as the patient's history of intravenous drug abuse and recent travel to Nicaragua increase the likelihood that he has developed an infection with a Gram-positive bacillus, such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes."
632,"Question: A 42-year-old homeless man is brought to the emergency room after he was found unconscious in a park. He has alcohol on his breath and is known to have a history of chronic alcoholism. A noncontrast CT scan of the head is normal. The patient is treated for acute alcohol intoxication and admitted to the hospital. The next day, the patient demands to be released. His vital signs are a pulse 120/min, a respiratory rate 22/min, and blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is confused, agitated, and sweating profusely, particularly from his palms. Generalized pallor is present. What is the mechanism of action of the drug recommended to treat this patient's most likely condition?

Question:

Options:

A. It increases the duration of GABA-gated chloride channel opening.
B. It increases the frequency of GABA-gated chloride channel opening.
C. It decreases the frequency of GABA-gated chloride channel opening.
D. It decreases the duration of GABA-gated chloride channel opening.

Answer: B. It increases the frequency of GABA-gated chloride channel opening.

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of confusion, agitation, and profuse sweating are consistent with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are commonly used to treat alcohol withdrawal syndrome by increasing the frequency of GABA-gated chloride channel opening. This action helps to restore the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to a reduction in symptoms of anxiety and agitation. Therefore, the drug recommended to treat the patient's condition is likely to be a benzodiazepine that increases the frequency of GABA-gated chloride channel opening."
633,"Question: A 42-year-old woman presents with difficulty focusing. She reports that she has trouble concentrating on simple tasks and her thoughts are very scattered, which have been persistent since her elementary school days. She states that she experienced difficulty focusing both at school and at home. The patient is prescribed the medication as the first-line treatment for her psychiatric condition. Which of the following statements is true regarding this medication?

A. ""Appetite suppression is a common side effect of this medication.""

B. ""Bupropion is less effective in adults with this disorder than this medication.""

C. ""Chronic use of this medication can lead to tardive dyskinesia.""

D. ""Hypotension is a common side effect of this medication.""

Answer: A. ""Appetite suppression is a common side effect of this medication.""

Explanation: The medication prescribed for the patient is likely an antidepressant, as the patient is experiencing difficulty focusing and has a history of this symptom since childhood. Appetite suppression is a common side effect of many antidepressants, including the one prescribed for this patient. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
634,"Question: A 32-year-old G6P1 woman presents to the obstetrician for a prenatal visit at 8 weeks gestation, concerned about the risk of recurrent miscarriage. She has had 4 spontaneous abortions in the past, all occurring during the first trimester. She has been following a strictly organic diet and takes a daily prenatal vitamin. She quit smoking after her first miscarriage. Labs drawn during the current visit show:

Leukocyte count: 7,800/mm^3
Platelet count: 230,000/mm^3
Hemoglobin: 12.6 g/dL
Prothrombin time: 13 seconds
Activated partial thromboplastin time: 48 seconds
International normalized ratio: 1.2

What is the best next step in management?

A) Corticosteroids
B) Low molecular weight heparin
C) Intramuscular benzathine penicillin G
D) Vitamin K

Answer: B) Low molecular weight heparin

Rationale: The patient's history of recurrent miscarriage and positive VDRL and negative FTA-ABS test results suggest a possible diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Low molecular weight heparin is the recommended first-line treatment for APS during pregnancy, as it can help prevent recurrent miscarriage and promote fetal growth. Corticosteroids, while effective in preventing preterm birth, are not recommended for APS management during pregnancy. Intramuscular benzathine penicillin G is not typically used in the management of APS. Vitamin K is not relevant to this case."
635,"Question: Two days after being admitted to the hospital due to severe peripartum vaginal bleeding during a home birth, a 40-year-old woman experiences a 30-second generalized convulsive seizure followed by unconsciousness. Prior to the event, she complained of acute onset of sweating and uncontrollable shivering. She was hemodynamically unstable and required several liters of intravenous fluids and 5 units of packed red blood cells in the intensive care unit. The patient's two prior pregnancies were uncomplicated. She is otherwise healthy. Prior to admission, her only medication was a daily prenatal vitamin. Temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 18/min, blood pressure is 101/61 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Examination shows very little milk expression from the breasts bilaterally. Finger-stick glucose level is 36 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?

A. Lactotrophic adenoma: This is a rare benign tumor of the lactotroph cells in the pituitary gland that can cause excessive milk production and other hormonal imbalances. However, in this case, the patient's recent onset of uncontrollable sweating and shivering, along with her recent hemodynamic instability, suggest that a more serious underlying condition is likely.

B. Hypoactive thyroid: Hypothyroidism can cause a range of symptoms including fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation. However, in this case, the patient's recent onset of seizures and unconsciousness suggest that another condition is more likely to be the cause.

C. Pituitary ischemia: This is a condition where the blood flow to the pituitary gland is reduced or blocked, leading to hormonal imbalances and a range of symptoms including headache, visual disturbances, and seizures. The patient's recent onset of seizures and unconsciousness, along with her recent hemodynamic instability, suggest that pituitary ischemia is the most likely underlying cause.

D. Hypothalamic infarction: This is a condition where there is damage to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that regulates various bodily functions, including hormonal balance. However, in this case, the patient's recent onset of seizures and unconsciousness suggest that another condition is more likely to be the cause.

In conclusion, based on the symptoms and laboratory results presented, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition is pituitary ischemia."

638,"Question: A 58-year-old woman presents with a 2-week history of fever, fatigue, generalized weakness, and bleeding gums. Which of the following chromosomal translocations is most likely responsible for this patient's condition?

Options:
A. t(9;22)
B. t(15;17)
C. t(11;14)
D. t(8;14)

Answer: B. t(15;17)

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly the presence of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. The bone marrow biopsy findings of > 20 % myeloperoxidase positive myeloblasts with splinter-shaped structures in the cytosol are also consistent with AML. Chromosomal translocation t(15;17)(q22;q21) is a common translocation seen in AML, particularly in older adults, and is associated with a poor prognosis. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
639,"Question: A 69-year-old white man presents to the physician with a 15-day history of fatigue and lower leg swelling. He has lost 3.8 kg (8.3 lb) in the past 8 months and has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 48 years. Vital signs are normal, and he appears thin.

640,"Question: A 14-year-old boy presents with progressive swelling of his legs and generalized fatigue over the past month, along with a productive cough and shortness of breath. He has a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections and chronic nasal congestion since childhood, and has recently experienced foul-smelling and greasy stools. His height and weight are below average, and he has clubbing of his fingers and scoliosis on examination. His vital signs are normal, but he has 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities, jugular venous distension, and inspiratory crackles in the thorax. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: This condition is characterized by an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, which can lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, and heart failure. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

B. Protein malnutrition: This condition occurs when the body does not get enough protein, leading to edema, fatigue, and weight loss. However, the patient's edema and weight status do not suggest this diagnosis.

C. Goodpasture syndrome: This is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the lungs and kidneys, causing proteinuria, hematuria, and respiratory symptoms. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

D. Cystic fibrosis: This is a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. It is characterized by persistent respiratory infections, digestive problems, and saltiness of sweat. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are highly suggestive of cystic fibrosis, particularly the clubbing of his fingers and scoliosis.

Answer: D. Cystic fibrosis"
641,"Question: A 36-year-old woman with a past medical history of diabetes presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. She reports that her gynecologist told her she had ""some cysts in her ovaries but not to worry about it."" The pain started last night and has progressively worsened. She denies any other symptoms such as headache, dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea, diarrhea, or constipation. However, she endorses nausea, dysuria for the past 3 days, and chills. Her temperature is 100.7°F (38.2°C), blood pressure is 132/94 mmHg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination reveals right lower quadrant and flank pain with voluntary guarding. What is the most likely pathophysiology of this patient's condition?

A. Ascending infection of the urinary tract: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea, along with the presence of voluntary guarding on physical examination, suggest that an infection in the urinary tract is the most likely cause. The patient's history of diabetes also increases the likelihood of a urinary tract infection (UTI) as people with diabetes are at higher risk for UTIs.

B. Cessation of venous drainage from the ovaries: The patient's history of ""some cysts in her ovaries"" but being told not to worry about it is unlikely to be the cause of her current symptoms. While ovarian cysts can cause abdominal pain, they typically do not cause nausea or dysuria.

C. Inflammation of the appendix: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea, along with the presence of guarding on physical examination, suggest that inflammation of the appendix is a possible cause. However, the patient's history of diabetes and the absence of any other symptoms such as fever, chills, or loss of appetite make this option less likely.

D. Vesicoureteral reflex: This option is not a likely cause for the patient's symptoms as it is a rare condition that occurs in response to a urinary tract infection and is characterized by flank pain and nausea. The patient's symptoms do not match the criteria for vesicoureteral reflex."
642,"Question: A 26-year-old man with HIV and a recent CD4+ count of 800 presents to his primary care physician (PCP) with fever, cough, and dyspnea. He reports that he recently lost his job as a construction worker and has not been able to afford his highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medication. His temperature is 102.6°F (39.2°C), pulse is 75/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 135/92 mmHg. Physical exam reveals a tachypneic patient with scattered crackles in both lungs, and laboratory tests show a CD4+ count of 145 and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The chest radiography is notable for bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates. To confirm the diagnosis, the physician orders a sputum sample for staining. Which stain is most likely to reveal the responsible organism?

A. Ziehl-Neelsen stain
B. Silver stain
C. India ink stain
D. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain

Answer: B. Silver stain

Explanation: In this case, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible pulmonary infection, such as pneumonia. The most common causative organisms of pneumonia in HIV patients are Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Silver stain is the most appropriate stain to use in this case, as it is sensitive for detecting the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB), which are characteristic of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The other stains listed (Ziehl-Neelsen, India ink, and PAS) are not as sensitive for detecting AFB and are therefore less likely to reveal the responsible organism in this case."
643,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 43-year-old woman visits her primary care physician for a routine checkup. She has been experiencing uncontrollable grimacing and smacking of her lips for the past two months, which have been worsening over time. The patient has a history of schizophrenia managed with clozapine. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

Options:
A. Torticollis - This condition involves an unintentional twisting or tilting of the neck, which can cause the head to rotate or tilt to one side. While torticollis can cause facial grimacing, it is not typically associated with smacking of the lips.
B. Oculogyric crisis - This is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of neuroleptic medication, including clozapine. It can cause rapid eye movements, head tilt, and neck stiffness, but does not typically involve smacking of the lips.
C. Tourette's syndrome - This is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements and vocalizations, including grimacing and smacking of the lips. However, Tourette's syndrome is typically associated with multiple other symptoms, such as eye blinking, head jerking, and vocalizations, and is not typically caused by a single medication like clozapine.
D. Tardive dyskinesia - This is a serious side effect of long-term use of neuroleptic medications, including clozapine. It can cause involuntary movements of the face, including smacking of the lips, as well as other parts of the body. Tardive dyskinesia can be difficult to diagnose, as it can be similar in appearance to other conditions like Tourette's syndrome or Parkinson's disease.

Answer: D. Tardive dyskinesia."
644,"Sure! Here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 22-year-old soldier is rushed to the combat medic after sustaining a stab wound to the chest during a military attack in Mali. He is experiencing shortness of breath and is brought in for a primary survey. His vital signs are: pulse 99/min, respirations 32/min, blood pressure 112/72 mm Hg. Upon examination, a 2-cm wound is found at the left fourth intercostal space at the midclavicular line, with bubbling of blood seen with each respiration at the wound site. There is no jugular venous distention, and the trachea is at the midline. What is the most appropriate next step in management?

A) Partially occlusive dressing: This option is the most appropriate next step in management. A partially occlusive dressing can help to control bleeding and reduce the risk of further injury to the chest cavity.

B) Emergency pericardiocentesis: This option is not the most appropriate next step in management. Pericardiocentesis is a procedure that involves inserting a needle into the pericardial space to drain blood or fluid, but it is not necessary in this case as the wound is not causing any significant bleeding.

C) Emergency echocardiography: This option is not the most appropriate next step in management. While echocardiography can be useful in assessing cardiac function, it is not necessary in this case as the soldier's vital signs are stable and there is no evidence of cardiac injury.

D) Supplemental oxygen: This option is not the most appropriate next step in management. While oxygen therapy may be necessary if the soldier's oxygen saturation levels are low, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case as the soldier's vital signs are stable and there is no evidence of respiratory distress."
645,"Question: A 48-year-old woman presents with a sudden-onset severe headache, binocular horizontal diplopia, and ptosis. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension. What is the most likely structure to be abnormal in this patient?

Options:
A. Anterior communicating artery (ACom)
B. Posterior communicating artery (PCom)
C. Middle cerebral artery (MCA)
D. Pericallosal artery

Answer: B. Posterior communicating artery (PCom)

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset severe headache, binocular horizontal diplopia, and ptosis are consistent with a posterior communicating artery (PCom) aneurysm or occlusion. The PCom is a critical structure in the circulation of the brain, responsible for supplying blood to the posterior cerebral hemisphere, including the visual pathway. The presence of diplopia and ptosis suggests that the PCom is involved, and the absence of a pupillary light response on the left side further supports this diagnosis. The other options are less likely to be involved in this patient's presentation."
646,"Question: A 32-year-old female with a history of depression presents to the emergency department after a suspected ingestion. She is confused, reporting blurry vision, and responding to visual hallucinations. Vital signs are as follows:

Temperature: 98.9 degrees Fahrenheit (37.2 Celsius)
Heart Rate: 105 bpm
Blood Pressure: 90/65 mmHg
Respiratory Rate: 21 respirations per minute
O2 Saturation: 99% on room air

Upon reviewing her ECG (shown in Image A), the emergency room physician orders sodium bicarbonate. What medication was the likely cause of this patient's cardiac abnormality?

A. Lithium
B. Amitriptyline
C. Paroxetine
D. Quetiapine

Answer: B. Amitriptyline

Explanation: The ECG in Image A shows a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 105 bpm, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms of confusion and visual hallucinations. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, can cause cardiac abnormalities such as tachycardia and QT prolongation. While lithium, paroxetine, and quetiapine are also antidepressants, they are less likely to cause cardiac abnormalities compared to amitriptyline."
647,"Question: A 39-year-old G3P0 woman presents for preconception counseling and evaluation. The patient's past medical history reveals hypertension and type 1 diabetes. She is currently on an insulin pump and medications for hypertension including labetalol. Her blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg; pulse, 76/min; and BMI, 26 kg/m2. Her most recent HbA1c is 6.5%. Her previous pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortion during the 1st trimester despite adequate prenatal care. The patient intends to have a healthy pregnancy and desires to learn more about the risk factors that potentially trigger miscarriage. Which of the following maternal risk factors is most likely associated with early pregnancy loss?

Options:

A. Chronic hypertension
B. Diabetes
C. Age
D. Hypercoagulable state

Answer: C. Age

Explanation:

The patient's age of 39 years is a significant risk factor for early pregnancy loss. Studies have shown that the risk of miscarriage increases with advancing maternal age, particularly after the age of 35. This is due to the decline in the quality and quantity of the eggs in the ovaries, which can lead to chromosomal abnormalities and increase the risk of miscarriage. In this case, the patient's age is the most likely risk factor associated with early pregnancy loss."
648,"Question: A 36-year-old gravida 1, para 1 woman presents with fever and pain in her left leg 3 days after delivery of a male newborn. What is the most appropriate initial step in management?

Options:
A. Low molecular weight heparin
B. Embolectomy
C. Urokinase
D. Warfarin

Answer: A. Low molecular weight heparin

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fever and pain in the left leg are concerning for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can be a serious complication of pregnancy and childbirth. Low molecular weight heparin is the most appropriate initial step in management as it is effective in preventing and treating DVT. It works by inhibiting the activity of clotting factors and promoting fibrinolysis, which can help to dissolve the clot and prevent it from growing larger. Embolectomy, urokinase, and warfarin are not the most appropriate options for this patient's presentation. Embolectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing the clot, and it is not a suitable option for patients with DVT who are at risk of bleeding. Urokinase is a fibrinolytic agent that is used to treat acute myocardial infarction, and it may not be effective in treating DVT. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that is used to prevent and treat DVT, but it may take longer to act compared to low molecular weight heparin."
649,"Question: A 25-year-old male is brought into the emergency department by emergency medical services. The patient has a history of bipolar disease complicated by polysubstance use. He was found down in his apartment at the bottom of a staircase lying on his left arm. He was last seen several hours earlier by his roommate. He is disoriented and unable to answer any questions, but is breathing on his own. His vitals are HR 55, T 96.5, RR 18, BP 110/75. You decide to obtain an EKG as shown in Figure 1. What is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?

A. Intubation: Intubation may be considered if the patient is unresponsive and has a decreased level of consciousness, as seen in this case. However, since the patient is breathing on their own, intubation may not be necessary at this time.

B. Albuterol: Albuterol is a bronchodilator that may be used to treat respiratory distress or acute respiratory failure. However, in this case, the patient's vital signs are stable, and they are breathing on their own, so albuterol may not be necessary.

C. Insulin: Insulin may be considered if the patient has symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as confusion, agitation, or seizures. However, the patient's vital signs are normal, and they do not have any signs of hypoglycemia, so insulin is not necessary at this time.

D. Calcium gluconate: Calcium gluconate is a medication that may be used to treat hypocalcemia, or low calcium levels, which can cause muscle weakness, twitching, and seizures. However, the patient's vital signs are normal, and they do not have any signs of hypocalcemia, so calcium gluconate is not necessary at this time.

Therefore, the next best step in the treatment of this patient would be to continue monitoring their vital signs and observing their clinical condition, as they may require further interventions as their condition changes."
650,"Question: A primary care physician is recently receiving more negative online reviews from his patients. He is increasingly feeling tired and has written 2 wrong prescriptions over the past month alone. Currently, on his panel, he has a list of 1,051 patients, half of whom are geriatric patients. He spends approximately 51 hours per week visiting about 20 patients a day. He has no history of a serious illness and takes no medications. An evaluation by a psychiatrist shows no primary psychiatric disorders. According to recent national surveys, which of the following do physicians more frequently recognize as a contributor to this physician's current condition?

Options:

A. The number of patients on his panel - While the number of patients on the physician's panel may be a factor, it is not the most common reason for his current condition.

B. Excessive bureaucratic tasks - The excessive administrative tasks and paperwork required of physicians can lead to burnout and fatigue, which may be the main contributor to the physician's current condition.

C. Working too many hours - While the physician spends a significant amount of time seeing patients, it is not necessarily the number of hours worked that is the primary cause of his fatigue, but rather the administrative tasks and stress associated with the job.

D. Concern over online reputation - While the negative online reviews may be a source of stress for the physician, they are not the primary reason for his current condition.

Answer: B. Excessive bureaucratic tasks."
651,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 37-year-old woman has given birth to her first child via vaginal delivery and is experiencing difficulty voiding urine following the delivery. She had an epidural anesthesia during the delivery and the use of forceps resulted in pelvic trauma. She is currently experiencing urinary leakage and feels increased pressure in her lower abdomen. Which of the following treatments is most appropriate for this patient's condition?

Options:
A. Antimuscarinic drugs
B. Pelvic floor muscle strengthening exercises
C. Pessary insertion
D. Urethral catheterization

Answer: D. Urethral catheterization. This treatment is the most appropriate for the patient's condition as it will help to drain the bladder and alleviate the urinary leakage and increased pressure in the lower abdomen."
652,"Question: A 4-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of fatigue and generalized weakness for 4 months. Examination shows decreased muscle tone. Her fasting serum glucose concentration is 41 mg/dL. The physician suspects a defect in one of the enzymes involved in the carnitine shuttle. Increased serum concentration of which of the following should most raise suspicion of a different diagnosis?

Options:
A. β-hydroxybutyrate: Increased levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in the blood can indicate a metabolic disorder such as maple syrup urine disease, which is caused by a deficiency in the enzymes involved in the carnitine shuttle.
B. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): Elevated ALT levels can indicate liver damage or disease, which is unrelated to the carnitine shuttle.
C. Uric acid: Increased levels of uric acid in the blood can indicate a metabolic disorder such as gout, which is also unrelated to the carnitine shuttle.
D. Creatine kinase (CK): Elevated CK levels can indicate muscle damage or disease, which is also unrelated to the carnitine shuttle.

Answer: A. β-hydroxybutyrate."
653,"Sure! Here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 27-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, delivers twins via an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Both placentas are delivered shortly afterward. The patient received regular prenatal care and experienced no issues during her pregnancy. Over the next hour, she continues to experience vaginal bleeding, with an estimated blood loss of 1150 mL. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical exam shows an enlarged, soft uterus. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:
A. Methylergometrine: This medication is used to stimulate uterine contractions and help control bleeding after delivery. However, it may not be the best option in this case as the patient has already delivered the twins and the bleeding is ongoing.
B. Curettage with suctioning: This procedure involves scraping the uterine lining to remove any remaining tissue and stop bleeding. While it may be effective in controlling bleeding, it may not be necessary in this case as the patient has already delivered the twins and the bleeding is mild.
C. Tranexamic acid: This medication is used to reduce bleeding by blocking the breakdown of blood clots. While it may be useful in some cases of postpartum bleeding, it may not be the best option in this case as the patient has already delivered the twins and the bleeding is ongoing.
D. Bimanual uterine massage: This technique involves massaging the uterus to stimulate contractions and help control bleeding. It is a simple and non-invasive option that can be effective in controlling mild to moderate bleeding after delivery. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is D. Bimanual uterine massage."
654,"Question: A 69-year-old man presents to the physician with a 3-month history of urinary urgency, nocturia, and progressive lower back pain that worsens at night and does not respond to ibuprofen. Rectal examination reveals an enlarged, asymmetric prostate with a nodular surface, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are 11 ng/ml (normal < 4 ng/ml). A prostate biopsy shows a high-grade adenocarcinoma, and a CT scan of the pelvis reveals multiple osteoblastic lesions in the lumbar spine. Which of the following drugs is most likely to have been initiated in this patient's treatment plan?

A. Leuprolide
B. Flutamide
C. Degarelix
D. Docetaxel

Answer: B. Flutamide

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and diagnostic findings are consistent with metastatic prostate cancer, which is typically treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Flutamide is a non-steroidal anti-androgen that competes with androgens for interaction with the testosterone receptors, leading to inhibition of prostate cell growth and regression of metastases. Leuprolide, degarelix, and docetaxel are also ADT drugs, but they have different mechanisms of action and may not be as effective or appropriate for this patient's specific condition."
655,"Question: A 29-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician due to recurring episodes of intense fear, accompanied by chest pain, lightheadedness, sweating, and palpitations. She experiences a feeling of choking, leading to hyperventilation, and is afraid these episodes may occur while driving or working. Despite avoiding social interactions and relying on friends for transportation, these changes have not stopped the episodes. Which of the following personality disorders is most likely genetically associated with this patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. Criminality and disregard for the rights of others - This option is not relevant to the patient's symptoms, as there is no indication of aggressive or violent behavior.

B. Eccentric appearance and magical thinking - This option does not accurately describe the patient's symptoms or personality traits.

C. Social withdrawal and limited emotional expression - While the patient may be avoiding social interactions due to her fear, she is not exhibiting signs of social withdrawal or limited emotional expression.

D. Submissive, clingy, and low self-confidence - The patient's symptoms are more consistent with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which is often associated with feelings of anxiety, fear, and a need for control. A person with OCD may exhibit submissive, clingy, and low self-confidence traits, making option D the most likely answer.

Answer: D. Submissive, clingy, and low self-confidence."
656,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 22-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation presents with several hours of abdominal cramping and passing of large vaginal blood clots. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.3°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg. The uterus is consistent in size with a 12-week gestation. Speculum exam shows an open cervical os and blood clots within the vaginal vault. Transvaginal ultrasound shows an empty gestational sac. The patient is concerned about undergoing invasive procedures. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A. Expectant management: This option involves closely monitoring the patient's condition and waiting for any changes or progression of the miscarriage. This approach is often chosen when the patient's condition is stable and there are no signs of infection or other complications.

B. Methotrexate therapy: This option involves administering a medication called methotrexate to help promote uterine contractions and expel the pregnancy tissue. This approach is often used in cases of incomplete abortion or miscarriage.

C. Serial beta-hCG measurement: This option involves measuring the levels of the pregnancy hormone beta-hCG to determine if the pregnancy is continuing or if it has terminated. This approach can help identify if the miscarriage is complete or ongoing.

D. Oxytocin therapy: This option involves administering a medication called oxytocin to help stimulate uterine contractions and promote expulsion of the pregnancy tissue. This approach is often used in cases of incomplete abortion or miscarriage.

Answer: A. Expectant management"
657,"Question: A 34-year-old male visits the clinic with complaints of intermittent diarrhea over the past 6 months. He has lost 6.8 kg (15 lb) over that time period. His frequent bowel movements are affecting his social life and he would like definitive treatment. Past medical history is significant for chronic type 2 diabetes that is well controlled with insulin. No other family member has a similar condition. He does not smoke tobacco and drinks alcohol only on weekends. Today, his vitals are within normal limits. On physical exam, he appears gaunt and anxious. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Additionally, the patient has a red-purple rash on his lower abdomen, groin, and the dorsum of both hands. The rash consists of pruritic annular lesions. He is referred to a dermatologist for core biopsy which is consistent with necrolytic migratory erythema. Further workup reveals a large hormone secreting mass in the tail of his pancreas. Which of the following is the action of the hormone that is in excess in this patient?

A. Activation of glycogen synthase: Glycogen synthase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glucose to glycogen, which is an important energy storage molecule in the body. However, in this patient, the excess hormone is stimulating lipolysis, which is the breakdown of fat for energy, rather than glycogen synthesis. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

B. Inhibition of acetone production: Acetone is a ketone body that is produced when the body breaks down fat for energy. In this patient, the excess hormone is stimulating lipolysis, which leads to increased acetone production. However, this is not the correct answer.

C. Inhibition of gluconeogenesis: Gluconeogenesis is the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as amino acids and lactate. In this patient, the excess hormone is stimulating lipolysis, which does not affect gluconeogenesis. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

D. Stimulation of lipolysis: Lipolysis is the breakdown of fat for energy, and the excess hormone in this patient is stimulating this process. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
658,"Question: A 57-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and hypertension accidentally overdoses on antiarrhythmic medication.

Options:

A. Quinidine and insulin
B. Encainide and epinephrine
C. Esmolol and glucagon
D. Sotalol and norepinephrine

Answer: C. Esmolol and glucagon

Explanation:
Esmolol is an antiarrhythmic drug that is used to treat overdose of other antiarrhythmics, such as quinidine. Glucagon is a hormone that can help to counteract the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on the heart, by increasing the heart's ability to beat normally. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Esmolol and glucagon."
659,"Question: A 30-year-old African American woman presents with a facial rash in a ""butterfly"" pattern and complains of feeling tired and achy in her joints. As part of her rheumatologic workup, you discover that she has anti-snRNP antibodies. Which of the following processes are affected by snRNPs?

A. Polyadenylation of the 3' end of mRNA
B. Protection of mRNA from degradation
C. Intron removal from the mRNA
D. Transcription of mRNA

Answer: C. Intron removal from the mRNA

Explanation: snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins) are proteins that play a crucial role in the splicing of mRNA, which is the process of removing introns (non-coding regions) and joining exons (coding regions) together to form a mature mRNA molecule. The presence of anti-snRNP antibodies in this patient's bloodwork suggests that her immune system is attacking these proteins, leading to defects in mRNA splicing and potentially causing the symptoms she is experiencing."
660,"Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with difficulty breathing. His mother reports that he developed a fever last night and began to have trouble breathing this morning. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is unvaccinated (conscientious objection by the family) and is meeting all developmental milestones. At the hospital, his vitals are temperature 39.8°C (103.6°F), pulse 122/min, respiration rate 33/min, blood pressure 110/66 mm Hg, and SpO2 93% on room air. On physical examination, he appears ill with his neck hyperextended and chin protruding. His voice is muffled and he is drooling. The pediatrician explains that there is one particular bacteria that commonly causes these symptoms. At what age should the patient have first received vaccination to prevent this condition from this particular bacteria?

A. At 2-months-old

The recommended age for the first vaccination against the particular bacteria that causes this condition is 2 months old. This is because the vaccine is typically given to infants at 2 months old as part of their routine immunization schedule to protect against this and other serious bacterial infections. By giving the vaccine at this age, the child's immune system can mount an effective response and provide protection against the bacteria before they are exposed to it in the environment."
661,"Question: A data analyst is putting systolic blood pressure values into a spreadsheet for a research study on hypertension during pregnancy. The majority of systolic blood pressure values fall between 130 and 145. For one of the study participants, she accidentally types “1400” instead of “140”. Which of the following statements is most likely to be correct?

Options:
A. This is a systematic error.
B. The standard deviation of the data set is decreased.
C. The range of the data set is unaffected.
D. The median is now smaller than the mean.

Answer: D. The median is now smaller than the mean.

Explanation: When a single large value is accidentally entered into a data set, it can have a significant impact on the median. In this case, the median is likely to be lower than the mean because the large value of 1400 is an outlier compared to the other values in the data set. The mean is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values, so it is more affected by the presence of outliers than the median. The median, on the other hand, is the middle value in the data set, and is less affected by outliers. Therefore, it is most likely that the median is now smaller than the mean."
662,"Question: A 10-year-old girl presents to the clinic with a circular, itchy rash on her scalp that has been persistent for the past 3 weeks, along with hair loss. Her mother is also concerned about her condition. The girl has a history of asthma and uses an albuterol inhaler once a week on average. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure: 112/70 mm Hg, heart rate: 104/min, respiratory rate: 20/min, temperature: 37.0°C (98.6°F). On examination, the patient is alert and interactive, and her lungs are clear on bilateral auscultation. A tender posterior cervical node is palpable on the right side, and the examination of her head is shown in the image. Which of the following is the best treatment option for the patient?

A. Subcutaneous triamcinolone injection
B. Ketoconazole shampoo
C. Oral doxycycline
D. Oral terbinafine

Answer: D. Oral terbinafine

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of a circular, itchy rash on her scalp and hair loss are consistent with tinea capitis, a common fungal infection of the scalp. Oral terbinafine is an effective treatment option for tinea capitis, as it has broad-spectrum antifungal activity against common fungal pathogens that cause the infection. Subcutaneous triamcinolone injection may provide temporary relief of itching, but it may not be effective in treating the underlying fungal infection. Ketoconazole shampoo may also be effective in treating tinea capitis, but it may take longer to show results than oral terbinafine. Oral doxycycline is an antibiotic that may be effective in treating bacterial superinfection, but it may not be effective in treating the fungal infection itself."
663,"Question: A 24-year-old man is rushed to the emergency department by his brother due to a 3-hour history of lethargy and confusion. The brother reveals that the patient ingested several large-capped mushrooms he found in the woods 2 days ago, leading to severe, bloody diarrhea that has since resolved. The patient's vital signs are as follows: pulse: 140/min, respirations: 26/min, blood pressure: 98/62 mm Hg. Upon examination, the patient's mucous membranes are dry, and there is tenderness to deep palpation in the right upper quadrant. Serum studies reveal an elevated AST concentration of 2335 U/L and ALT concentration of 2294 U/L. The most likely cause of the patient's condition is:

A. Disruption of messenger RNA synthesis
B. Inhibition of microtubule polymerization
C. Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system
D. Depolarization of cells

Answer: A. Disruption of messenger RNA synthesis

Explanation: The patient's elevated AST and ALT concentrations, along with the symptoms of lethargy and confusion, suggest liver dysfunction. The ingestion of large amounts of mushrooms containing hepatotoxic compounds can lead to liver damage and disrupt messenger RNA synthesis, which is essential for protein synthesis and various cellular processes. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause of the patient's condition."
664,"Question: A 65-year-old male who is being treated for depression visits your emergency room complaining of being unable to urinate, tachycardia, and dry mouth. In addition, the patient has no history of benign prostatic hyperplasia and reports only being on one psychiatric medication. What type of psychiatric medication would cause such a side effect profile?

Options:

A. Monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) - This class of medications can cause anticholinergic effects, which can lead to urinary retention and dry mouth.
B. Aminoketone - This type of medication is not associated with the side effect profile described in the question.
C. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) - SSRIs can cause anticholinergic effects, but they are less likely to cause urinary retention compared to MAOIs.
D. Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) - TCAs are known to cause anticholinergic effects, including urinary retention and dry mouth, which can be a common side effect of this class of medications.

Answer: D. Tricyclic antidepressant"
665,"Question: A 60-year-old woman presents with changes in her left breast that started 1 month ago. The patient states that she noticed that an area of her left breast felt thicker than before, and has not improved. She came to get it checked out because her best friend was just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. The past medical history is significant for Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, well-managed medically with levothyroxine. The patient has a 30-pack-year smoking history, but she quit over 15 years ago. The menarche occurred at age 11, and the menopause was at age 53. She does not have any children and has never been sexually active. Her last screening mammogram 10 months ago was normal. The family history is significant for her mother dying from a myocardial infarction (MI) at age 68, her sister dying from metastatic breast cancer at age 55, and for colon cancer in her paternal grandfather. The review of systems is notable for unintentional weight loss of 3.6 kg (8 lb) in the past month. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉), blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, pulse 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The physical examination is significant only for a minimally palpable mass with irregular, poorly defined margins in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. The mass is rubbery and movable. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy noted. Which of the following characteristics is associated with this patient’s most likely type of breast cancer in comparison to her friend’s diagnosis?

B. Can present bilaterally

Explanation: The patient's history of unilateral breast cancer (left breast) and the presence of a palpable mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast suggest that the patient's cancer is likely to be a unilateral, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), similar to her friend's diagnosis. Bilateral breast cancer is less common than unilateral breast cancer, and the patient's history of unilateral breast cancer increases the likelihood that the cancer will be located in the same breast as the previous cancer. Additionally, the patient's age and family history of breast cancer also support a diagnosis of IDC.

Option A, ""Worse prognosis,"" is incorrect because the patient's age and family history do not suggest a worse prognosis compared to her friend's diagnosis.

Option C, ""Higher prevalence,"" is incorrect because breast cancer is not more common in the patient's age group compared to the general population.

Option D, ""Mammogram is more likely to demonstrate a discrete spiculated mass,"" is incorrect because the patient's mammogram was normal 10 months ago, and the mass was only appreciated on physical examination."
666,"Question: A 64-year-old man presents to the physician with a 2-week history of persistent hiccups and shortness of breath upon exertion, along with a 1-month history of left shoulder pain. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. Upon physical examination, decreased breath sounds are noted at the left lung base. An x-ray of the chest reveals a 3-cm perihilar mass and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Which nerve is most likely injured in this patient, given these symptoms?

Options:
A. Vagus nerve
B. phrenic nerve
C. Intercostal nerve
D. Pagel's nerve

Answer: B. Phrenic nerve"
667,"Question: A 48-year-old woman with a history of osteoarthritis and hypertension presents to the office complaining of persistent abdominal pain for the last 2 months. She describes the pain as 'burning and achy' that is worse when she eats, which has lead to a weight loss of 4.5 kg (10.0 lb). The patient is currently taking lisinopril and atenolol for her blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for her osteoarthritis. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate is 75/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. An endoscopy is performed and a gastric ulcer is visualized and biopsied. The biopsy reveals H. pylori infection. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor to this patient's diagnosis?

A. Chronic NSAID use: The patient's history of chronic NSAID use increases her risk of developing a gastric ulcer, as these medications can irritate the stomach lining and lead to ulceration. Therefore, option A is the most likely predisposing factor to the patient's diagnosis.

B. Longstanding GERD: Although the patient has a history of GERD, it is not the most likely predisposing factor to her diagnosis. GERD can cause symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation, but it is less likely to result in the development of a gastric ulcer.

C. Age and gender: The patient's age and gender do not significantly increase her risk of developing a gastric ulcer.

D. A congenital diverticulum: A congenital diverticulum is a rare condition that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but it is not the most likely predisposing factor to the patient's diagnosis."
668,"Question: A 7-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother due to a 5-day history of fever, fatigue, and red spots on her body. What is the most likely cause of her findings?

Options:
A. Aplastic anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin concentration, leukocyte count, and platelet count, along with the presence of pallor and petechiae, are consistent with aplastic anemia. This condition is characterized by a failure of the bone marrow to produce blood cells, leading to anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.

B. Multiple myeloma: While multiple myeloma can cause bone marrow hypocellularity, the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms such as bone pain or hypercalcemia make this condition less likely.

C. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: ITP is a autoimmune disorder that can cause thrombocytopenia, but the patient's age and the presence of red spots on her body suggest a different underlying cause.

D. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia: While leukemia can cause pallor, fatigue, and anemia, the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms such as lymphadenopathy or bone pain make this condition less likely.

Answer: A. Aplastic anemia"
669,"Question: A 45-year-old woman presents with heavy menstrual bleeding between her periods, along with complaints of irregular menstrual cycles, weight loss, bloating, and constipation. She has had three uncomplicated pregnancies and has never taken oral contraception. There is no family history of gynecological malignancy, but her grandfather and mother had colon cancer diagnosed before the age of 50. On physical examination, the patient appears pale, and gynecological examination reveals a bloody cervical discharge and slight uterine enlargement. Endometrial biopsy shows endometrial adenocarcinoma. Colonoscopy reveals several polyps in the ascending colon, which are histologically confirmed as adenocarcinomas. Which of the following mechanisms of DNA repair is likely to be disrupted in this patient?

A. Nucleotide-excision repair
B. Base-excision repair
C. Mismatch repair
D. Non-homologous end joining

Answer: C. Mismatch repair

Explanation: The patient's history of colon cancer in her grandfather and mother, both diagnosed before the age of 50, suggests a possible genetic predisposition to cancer. Mismatch repair is a mechanism that helps to correct errors in DNA replication and repair, and it is known to be disrupted in some hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes. The presence of multiple adenomatous polyps in the colon, including those that are histologically confirmed as adenocarcinomas, also supports the likelihood of a disruption in the mismatch repair mechanism.

Nucleotide-excision repair (A) is a mechanism that repairs DNA damage caused by UV light and certain chemicals, but it is not typically involved in the development of colorectal cancer. Base-excision repair (B) is another mechanism that repairs damage to individual bases in DNA, but it is also not typically associated with colorectal cancer. Non-homologous end joining (D) is a mechanism that repairs DNA double-strand breaks, but it is not directly involved in the development of colorectal cancer.

Therefore, based on the patient's clinical presentation and family history, it is most likely that the mechanism of DNA repair that is disrupted in this patient is mismatch repair (C)."
670,"Question:
Inhaled Anesthetic Properties Study

Options:

A. Agent A is the most potent
B. Agent A has the fastest onset of action
C. Agent B is the most potent
D. Agent C has the fastest onset of action

Answer: B. Agent A has the fastest onset of action

Explanation:
The blood-gas partition coefficient (BGC) value of 0.15 for Agent A indicates that it is less soluble in blood than in gas. This means that Agent A will take longer to reach its peak effectiveness after inhalation, resulting in a slower onset of action. On the other hand, the BGC value of 0.92 for Agent B indicates that it is more soluble in blood than in gas, which means that it will reach its peak effectiveness faster after inhalation, resulting in a faster onset of action. Similarly, the BGC value of 5.42 for Agent C indicates that it is even more soluble in blood than Agent B, which means that it will have an even faster onset of action. Therefore, the accurate statement regarding these inhaled anesthetic substances is that Agent B has the fastest onset of action."

Question: An immunologist investigating the immune response administers a 0.5 mL intradermal injection of a sterilized microorganism to a participant. Four weeks later, a 12-mm, indurated, hypopigmented patch appears at the injection site. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this observed skin lesion?

Options:
A. An increase in B cells' antibody production
B. An increase in neutrophils' activity
C. An increase in CD4+ T cells' activity
D. An increase in transforming growth factor beta release

Answer: C. An increase in CD4+ T cells' activity."
672,"Question: A 65-year-old woman with COPD presents to the emergency department with 2 days of worsening shortness of breath and cough. Her sputum is more yellow than usual, but she has no fever, chills, sore throat, or runny nose. She is taking salmeterol twice daily. Her vital signs are: temperature 98°F, pulse 104/min, blood pressure 134/73 mm Hg, respiratory rate 22/min, and oxygen saturation 85%. She appears uncomfortable and has labored breathing. Lung auscultation reveals coarse bibasilar inspiratory crackles. A chest X-ray shows mild hyperinflation and flattening of the diaphragm with no consolidation. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?

A. Albuterol and montelukast
B. Prednisone and salmeterol
C. Albuterol and theophylline
D. Prednisone and albuterol

Answer: D. Prednisone and albuterol

Rationale: The patient's worsening shortness of breath and cough, along with the presence of coarse bibasilar inspiratory crackles on lung auscultation, suggest the possibility of an exacerbation of COPD. Prednisone and albuterol are the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for managing COPD exacerbations. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation in the airways, while albuterol is a bronchodilator that can help improve lung function and reduce symptoms. Montelukast and theophylline are not the best options for managing COPD exacerbations, as they have different mechanisms of action and may not be effective in this context."
673,"Question: An 18-year-old man presents to the emergency department after his mother found him locked in his room rambling about a government conspiracy to brainwash him in subterranean tunnels. His mother reports that he has never exhibited such behavior before, but he stopped attending classes six months ago and was subsequently suspended from college. Over the past month, he has become increasingly withdrawn and isolated, drinking one to two beers daily and smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for three years, with occasional marijuana use. His father was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 25. The patient appears disheveled and detached, with a disorganized mental status examination and a self-reported ""good"" mood. Toxicology screening is negative. Which of the following is a favorable prognostic factor for this patient's condition?

A. Predominance of negative symptoms
B. Acute onset of symptoms
C. Lack of social support
D. Cannabis use

Answer: B. Acute onset of symptoms

Rationale: The acute onset of symptoms in this case suggests that the patient's current state is likely a manifestation of an underlying psychotic disorder, rather than a chronic condition that has been developing over time. This is a favorable prognostic factor, as it suggests that the patient may be more likely to respond to treatment and experience improvement in their symptoms. In contrast, a predominance of negative symptoms (such as a lack of motivation or emotional expression) or a lack of social support may indicate a poorer prognosis."
674,"Question: A 45-year-old female immigrant to the United States presents to a community health clinic with concerns about recurring episodes of disrupted vision, as well as itchy bumps on her back and lower extremities. She notes that several people from her hometown have gone blind after experiencing similar symptoms. Upon physical examination, black hyperpigmented nodules with edema and palpable lymphadenopathy are noted, but there is no visible discharge from the eyes. The underlying disease is likely transmitted by black flies. Which of the following pharmacotherapies is the most appropriate for this patient?

Options:

A. Diethylcarbamazine
B. Ivermectin
C. Mebendazole
D. Nifurtimox

Answer: B. Ivermectin

Explanation: Ivermectin is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient due to the likelihood that the underlying disease is caused by a parasitic infection transmitted by black flies. Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic drug that is effective against a range of parasites, including those that cause onchocerciasis, the disease that is likely affecting the patient. Diethylcarbamazine, mebendazole, and nifurtimox are not as effective against parasitic infections and are not the best options for this patient."
675,"Question: A 68-year-old woman is rushed to the emergency department by ambulance after her daughter found her unresponsive at home. She has a history of cardiac arrhythmias, diabetes, pericarditis, and a previous stroke. Upon examination, her temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 88/51 mmHg, pulse is 137/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals cold and clammy skin. Special tests reveal decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, increased systemic vascular resistance, and mildly decreased cardiac output. Which of the following interventions would most directly address the root cause of the patient's low blood pressure?

A. Administering antibiotics
B. Fluid resuscitation via IV
C. Relieving an obstruction
D. Vasopressor therapy

Answer: B. Intravenous fluids"
676,"Question: A 46-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of increasing left upper quadrant discomfort. She has a known history of type 1 Gaucher disease. On physical examination, her spleen is palpable 8 cm below the costal margin. Routine laboratory work reveals severe pancytopenia. After consultation with the patient on the risks of her condition, the patient decides to undergo a splenectomy. Which of the following is more likely to occur as a consequence of splenectomy in this patient?

Options:

A. Anemia - This is unlikely to occur as a consequence of splenectomy in this patient, as Gaucher disease can lead to anemia due to bone marrow fibrosis, but splenectomy itself is not likely to cause anemia.

B. Pneumococcal septicemia - As the patient's spleen is palpable 8 cm below the costal margin, it suggests that the spleen is enlarged, which increases the risk of bacterial colonization and infection. Pneumococcal septicemia is a common complication of splenectomy in patients with an enlarged spleen, and it is more likely to occur in this patient.

C. Thrombocytopenia - Thrombocytopenia can occur in patients with Gaucher disease due to bone marrow fibrosis, but it is not a direct consequence of splenectomy.

D. Staphylococcal septicemia - This is an unlikely consequence of splenectomy in this patient, as the risk of bacterial infection is higher in patients with a normal spleen.

Answer: B. Pneumococcal septicemia"
677,"Question: A 14-year-old male is brought to your psychiatric clinic after he was caught stealing his peers' belongings multiple times by his teacher. He is a straight-A student with many friends and is an outstanding football player. He describes his family as very loving and gets along with his older siblings. He also states that he has no ill will towards anyone he stole from in class. Although never caught, he admits that he would often steal things in stores or locker rooms when no one was looking in order to satisfy an intense impulse. Which of the following is the best diagnosis for this patient?

Options:

A. Manic episode - This patient's impulsive and compulsive behavior, as well as his lack of remorse for his actions, are indicative of a manic episode. Mania is a mood disorder characterized by elevated or irritable mood, increased energy and activity, and impulsive behavior.

B. Conduct disorder - This patient's repeated acts of stealing and lack of respect for the property of others are classic symptoms of conduct disorder. Conduct disorder is a psychiatric disorder characterized by a pattern of behavior in which the individual consistently fails to conform to social norms and expectations.

C. Kleptomania - This patient's compulsion to steal, even in the absence of any tangible reward or motivation, suggests a diagnosis of kleptomania. Kleptomania is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurring and compulsive stealing of objects, despite the absence of any tangible reward or motivation.

D. Schizophrenia - While this patient's impulsive behavior and lack of remorse could be indicative of schizophrenia, the absence of any delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized thinking suggests that schizophrenia is unlikely. Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by disorganized thinking, hallucinations, delusions, and a lack of motivation or interest in activities.

Answer: C. Kleptomania."
678,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 45-year-old man presents to the physician with numbness and tingling sensations in his fingers and toes for the past month, along with difficulty with balance while walking. Laboratory tests reveal an elevated hemoglobin concentration of 9.5 g/dL, as well as elevated levels of serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. Upon examination of his peripheral blood smear, hypersegmented neutrophils are noted. Based on these findings, which of the following is most likely to have contributed to this patient's condition?

Options:
A. Avoiding canned foods altogether
B. Taking cyanocobalamin supplements regularly
C. Consuming pyridoxine-rich foods
D. Increasing folic acid intake

Answer: B. Cyanocobalamin supplementation"
679,"Question: A 48-year-old woman presents to her physician for the evaluation of 24-hour blood pressure monitoring results, which revealed elevated nocturnal blood pressure. Over the past 3 months, she has experienced intermittent nausea, decreased appetite, and increasing weakness and fatigue during the day. The patient has a history of kidney stones and is currently taking lisinopril, amlodipine, and furosemide. Her height is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) and weight is 97 kg (214 lb), resulting in a BMI of 31 kg/m2. Her blood pressure is 152/98 mm Hg, and physical examination reveals no abnormalities. Serum electrolyte levels are as follows: Na+ 141 mEq/L, Cl− 101 mEq/L, K+ 4.5 mEq/L, HCO3− 24 mEq/L, and Calcium 12.9 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL. Which of the following is most likely to be revealed by further evaluation?

A. Increased serum aldosterone-to-renin ratio
B. Increased serum parathyroid hormone
C. Decreased renal blood flow
D. Decreased nocturnal oxygen saturation

Answer: B. Increased serum parathyroid hormone.

Explanation: The patient's elevated nocturnal blood pressure and history of kidney stones suggest that she may have primary aldosteronism, a condition in which the adrenal glands produce too much aldosterone, leading to hypertension and kidney damage. An increased serum parathyroid hormone level would be consistent with this diagnosis, as primary aldosteronism can lead to hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) and secondary hyperparathyroidism (increased parathyroid hormone levels)."
680,"Question: The 58-year-old Caucasian woman visits her primary care physician for an annual check-up, and her parathyroid levels are moderately elevated. What can explain this new finding?

Options:
A. Phosphate retention: As the woman has a history of chronic kidney disease, her body may be retaining phosphate, leading to an increase in her parathyroid levels.
B. Hyperuricemia: Hyperuricemia, or high levels of uric acid in the blood, can also cause elevated parathyroid levels.
C. Hypercalcemia: While not the most likely explanation for this finding, hypercalcemia, or high levels of calcium in the blood, could also contribute to elevated parathyroid levels.
D. Uremia: Uremia, or the accumulation of waste products in the blood due to kidney failure, is an unlikely cause of elevated parathyroid levels in this patient, as her estimated glomerular filtration rate has not changed since her last visit.

Answer: A. Phosphate retention"
681,"Question: A 63-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by the police after he was found in the streets lying unconscious on the ground. Both of his pupils are normal in size and reactive to light. There are no obvious signs of head trauma. The finger prick test shows a blood glucose level of 20 mg/dL. He has been brought to the emergency department due to acute alcohol intoxication several times. The vital signs include: blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature 35℃ (95℉). On general examination, he is pale looking and disheveled with an odor of EtOH. On physical examination, the abdomen is soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly. After giving a bolus of intravenous dextrose, thiamine, and naloxone, he spontaneously opens his eyes. Blood and urine samples are drawn for toxicology screening. The blood alcohol level comes out to be 300 mg/dL. What will be the most likely laboratory findings in this patient?

A. Hypersegmented neutrophils
B. Sickle cells
C. Macrocytosis MCV > 100fL
D. Howell-Jolly bodies

Answer: C. Macrocytosis MCV > 100fL

Explanation: The patient's blood alcohol level is extremely high, indicating severe alcohol poisoning. Macrocytosis, or an increase in the size of the red blood cells, is a common finding in patients with alcohol poisoning. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is likely to be above 100 fL in this patient. This is because alcohol can cause damage to the red blood cells, leading to their enlargement. The other options are not likely to be present in this patient's laboratory results. Hypersegmented neutrophils are not typically seen in alcohol poisoning, and sickle cells are not typically present in the blood of an unconscious patient. Howell-Jolly bodies are not a common finding in alcohol poisoning."
682,"Question: A 49-year-old man with HIV presents with a 1-month history of intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain. Abdominal examination reveals mild, diffuse tenderness throughout the lower quadrants. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 180/mm3 (normal ≥ 500/mm3). Colonoscopy shows multiple hemorrhagic nodules in the rectum and descending colon, and polymerase chain reaction of the lesions is positive for HHV-8. Which of the following histologic findings is most likely to be observed in the biopsied tissue?

A. Cords of atypical cells with extracellular mucin
B. Enlarged cells with intranuclear inclusion bodies
C. Polygonal cells with racket-shaped organelles
D. Spindle-shaped cells with leukocytic infiltration

Answer: D. Spindle-shaped cells with leukocytic infiltration.

The histologic findings in this case are most likely to show spindle-shaped cells with leukocytic infiltration, which is a characteristic feature of Kaposi's sarcoma, a common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. The other options (a, b, and c) are not consistent with the histopathological findings in this case."
683,"Question: A 52-year-old man presents to the physician with a 4-week history of progressive yellowing of the skin and sclera, along with low appetite, swollen legs, and difficulty fitting into his pants. He has no personal or family history of serious illness, drinks 1-2 beers on special occasions, and has lost interest in sexual intercourse recently. He is 178 cm tall and weighs 68 kg, with a BMI of 22 kg/m2. Vital signs are normal, and physical examination reveals yellowing of the skin and sclera, erythema of the palms, bilateral enlargement of breast tissue, and bilateral edema below the knees. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The liver is palpated 2-3 cm below the right costal margin, and hepatojugular reflux is absent. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?

A. Chronic viral hepatitis: The patient's symptoms of yellowing of the skin and sclera, low appetite, swollen legs, and difficulty fitting into his pants, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral enlargement of breast tissue and bilateral edema below the knees, suggest the possibility of chronic viral hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis viruses such as B and C can cause yellowing of the skin and sclera, as well as liver damage and inflammation, leading to swelling and edema in the legs and abdomen.

B. Congestive hepatopathy: This condition is characterized by liver inflammation and damage due to congestion and poor blood flow. The patient's symptoms of yellowing of the skin and sclera, low appetite, and difficulty fitting into his pants, along with the physical examination finding of bilateral enlargement of breast tissue, suggest the possibility of congestive hepatopathy. However, the absence of cardiopulmonary examination abnormalities suggests that this is unlikely to be the underlying cause.

C. Primary biliary cirrhosis: This is a chronic autoimmune liver disease that can cause yellowing of the skin and sclera, as well as liver inflammation and damage. The patient's symptoms of low appetite and difficulty fitting into his pants, along with the physical examination finding of bilateral enlargement of breast tissue, suggest the possibility of primary biliary cirrhosis. However, the absence of any personal or family history of serious illness and the lack of any other symptoms such as fatigue, fever, or joint pain make this diagnosis less likely.

D. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: This is a type of fatty liver disease that can cause yellowing of the skin and sclera, as well as liver inflammation and damage. The patient's symptoms of yellowing of the skin and sclera, low appetite, and difficulty fitting into his pants, along with the physical examination finding of bilateral enlargement of breast tissue, suggest the possibility of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. However, the patient's BMI of 22 kg/m2 is within the normal range, and the absence of any other symptoms such as fatigue, fever, or joint pain make this diagnosis less likely."
684,"Question: A 52-year-old woman presents to the physician for a routine physical examination. She has type 2 diabetes that she treats with metformin. Her pulse is 85/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, blood pressure is 162/96 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). Treatment with a first-line drug is initiated. Which of the following is the most likely effect of this medication?

Options:

A. Increased: The most likely effect of this medication is increased peripheral vascular resistance. Metformin works by increasing insulin sensitivity, which can lead to an increase in peripheral blood flow and, subsequently, increased peripheral vascular resistance.

B. Decreased: Decreased renin production is the most likely effect of this medication. Metformin can decrease renin production by reducing the amount of angiotensin II in the kidneys, which in turn can lead to a decrease in renin production.

C. Increased: Increased angiotensin II production is the most likely effect of this medication. Metformin can increase angiotensin II production by reducing the amount of angiotensin I in the kidneys, which can lead to an increase in angiotensin II production.

D. Decreased: Decreased peripheral vascular resistance is the most likely effect of this medication. Metformin can decrease peripheral vascular resistance by increasing insulin sensitivity, which can lead to a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance.

E. Increased: Increased 24-hour urine sodium production is the most likely effect of this medication. Metformin can increase 24-hour urine sodium production by reducing the amount of angiotensin II in the kidneys, which can lead to an increase in sodium reabsorption and, subsequently, increased 24-hour urine sodium production.

Answer: A. A"
685,"Question: A 23-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with an acute exacerbation of her 3-month history of low back and right leg pain. She describes the pain as severe, shock-like, and localized to her lower back and radiating straight down the back of her right thigh and to her calf, stopping at the ankle. Which muscle-nerve complex is involved in producing an S1 reflex?

Options:

A. Tibialis posterior-tibial nerve: This nerve does not play a role in producing an S1 reflex.

B. Sartorius-femoral nerve: This nerve does not play a role in producing an S1 reflex.

C. Adductors-obturator nerve: This nerve does not play a role in producing an S1 reflex.

D. Gastrocnemius/soleus-tibial nerve: This nerve is involved in producing an S1 reflex, as it innervates the muscles of the calf and foot, which are innervated by the S1 nerve root.

Answer: D. Gastrocnemius/soleus-tibial nerve."
686,"Question: A 43-year-old construction worker presents to the emergency department two hours after sustaining a deep laceration to his left forearm by a piece of soiled and rusted sheet metal. What is the appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis?

Options:
A. IV metronidazole only
B. Anthrax vaccine
C. Tetanus immunoglobulin only
D. Tetanus vaccine + immunoglobulin

Answer: D. Tetanus vaccine + immunoglobulin

Explanation: The patient's history of deep laceration to his left forearm, particularly one caused by a piece of soiled and rusted sheet metal, puts him at risk of developing tetanus. The patient does not recall receiving any vaccinations in the last 30 years and is unsure if he was vaccinated as a child, making him eligible for post-exposure prophylaxis. Tetanus vaccine + immunoglobulin is the appropriate choice as it provides both active and passive immunity against tetanus, which is essential in preventing the development of the disease. While IV metronidazole may be considered for the management of any potential infection, it is not a substitute for post-exposure prophylaxis against tetanus. The anthrax vaccine is not relevant in this scenario, as the patient has not been exposed to anthrax. Tetanus immunoglobulin alone may provide some protection against tetanus, but it may not be sufficient to fully protect the patient, particularly if the wound is heavily contaminated or if the patient has a pre-existing weakened immune system. Therefore, the combination of tetanus vaccine and immunoglobulin is the most appropriate choice for post-exposure prophylaxis."
687,"Question: A 65-year-old man with a 30-year history of smoking is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after the onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. His vital signs are as follows: pulse 116/min, respirations 22/min, blood pressure 156/88 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 98% on pulse oximetry. A grade 3/6, high-pitched, blowing, diastolic murmur is heard over the right upper sternal border. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. Tear in the tunica intima: This is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of a high-pitched, blowing diastolic murmur over the right upper sternal border are both consistent with coronary artery disease, which can lead to a tear in the tunica intima, the innermost layer of the artery wall.

B. Obstruction of the pulmonary arteries: While the patient's symptoms could potentially be caused by obstruction of the pulmonary arteries, this is less likely given the patient's history of smoking and the presence of a diastolic murmur over the right upper sternal border, which are both more consistent with coronary artery disease.

C. Rupture of a bulla in the lung: This is less likely given the patient's symptoms and the physical examination findings. While a bulla can cause shortness of breath and chest pain, it is typically associated with a different murmur than the high-pitched, blowing murmur heard in this patient.

D. Perforation of the esophageal wall: This is an unlikely cause of the patient's symptoms, given the patient's presentation and physical examination findings. While a perforation of the esophageal wall can cause shortness of breath and chest pain, it is typically associated with other symptoms such as odynophagia (chest pain on swallowing) and difficulty swallowing."
688,"Question: A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 3-hour history of severe chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and neck, accompanied by difficulty breathing and a sudden loss of responsiveness. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but is not compliant with his medications. Vitals show a blood pressure of 152/90 mm Hg, pulse of 106/min, respirations of 22/min, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. On physical exam, the patient is profusely diaphoretic and hunched over in distress, with a cardiac exam that is unremarkable and lungs that are clear to auscultation. During the exam, the patient suddenly becomes unresponsive and a pulse cannot be palpated. A stat ECG shows the following (see image).

Options:

A. Administer epinephrine: Incorrect. Epinephrine is not the next best step in management for this patient, as it is not a definitive treatment for cardiac arrest.

B. Synchronized cardioversion: Incorrect. Synchronized cardioversion is not necessary in this situation, as the patient has already become unresponsive and a pulse cannot be palpated.

C. Unsynchronized cardioversion: Correct. Unsynchronized cardioversion is the next best step in management for this patient, as it may help to restore a normal heart rhythm and improve the patient's symptoms.

D. Urgent echocardiography: Incorrect. While echocardiography may be useful in evaluating the patient's cardiac status, it is not the next best step in management in this situation.

Answer: C. Unsynchronized cardioversion."
689,"Question: The prison doctor encounters a 25-year-old man for minor injuries sustained during a recent lunchroom brawl. The patient has a long history of getting into trouble. During the interview, he appears charming and deflects responsibility, becoming hostile when probed. He is married with two young children, but does not pay child support. Which of the following aspects is most crucial for diagnosing this patient's condition?

Options:
A. Childhood history - The patient's history of getting into trouble may be linked to unresolved issues from their childhood, such as neglect, abuse, or unstable home life. Understanding the patient's childhood experiences can help identify underlying causes of their behavior.
B. Family history - The patient's family dynamics may have contributed to their behavioral issues. For example, if there is a history of substance abuse or mental health problems in the family, it could have influenced the patient's development and behavior.
C. Evidence of lack of remorse - The patient's unwillingness to take responsibility for their actions may indicate a lack of empathy or remorse, which can be a sign of a mental health condition such as antisocial personality disorder.
D. Criminal record - The patient's criminal history can provide valuable information about their mental state and behavior patterns. A history of violent or aggressive behavior may indicate a higher risk of future problems.

Answer: A. Childhood history"
690,"Question: A 22-year-old Caucasian female presents with severe right lower quadrant pain, malaise, and diarrhea. The physician performs an endoscopy and finds disease involvement in the terminal ileum, noting that the disease process is patchy with normal intervening mucosa. The entire wall of the region is thickened and inflamed, which may directly lead to the formation of:

A. Fistulas - The thickening and inflammation of the intestinal wall can lead to the formation of fistulas, which are abnormal connections between the intestine and other organs or tissues.

B. Toxic megacolon - The inflammation of the intestinal wall can cause a condition known as toxic megacolon, which is characterized by a dilated colon with a thickened wall and a distended abdomen.

C. Widening of the intestinal lumen - The inflammation of the intestinal wall can also lead to a widening of the intestinal lumen, which can cause abdominal pain and discomfort.

D. Plummer-Vinson syndrome - This is a rare condition that is characterized by inflammation of the intestinal wall, leading to abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.

Answer: A. Fistulas"
691,"Sure! Here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 40-year-old woman visits her primary care physician with a 5-month history of worsening bladder discomfort. She voids 10-15 times per day and wakes up 2-3 times per night to void, but has not experienced any involuntary loss of urine. Despite trying to reduce fluids and taking NSAIDs, her symptoms have not improved significantly. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and reports that sexual intercourse has become painful. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), her pulse is 65 beats per minute, and her blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. During examination, the suprapubic region is tender to palpation. Urinalysis shows:

A. Overactive bladder
B. Interstitial cystitis
C. Urinary retention
D. Diabetes insipidus

Answer: B. Interstitial cystitis"
692,"Question: A 64-year-old female with a long-standing history of poorly-controlled diabetes presents with 3 weeks of abnormal walking. She reports dragging her right toes while walking, leading to frequent toe stubbing. On examination, you notice a right unilateral foot drop with decreased sensation in the first dorsal web space, and the patient walks with a pronounced steppage gait. Which nerve deficit is most likely responsible for this presentation?

A. Superficial peroneal nerve
B. Deep peroneal nerve
C. Tibial nerve
D. Sural nerve

Answer: B. Deep peroneal nerve

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dragging the right toes while walking and decreased sensation in the first dorsal web space are consistent with a deep peroneal nerve deficit. The deep peroneal nerve provides sensation to the dorsal aspect of the foot, including the first web space, and any damage to this nerve can cause a foot drop and loss of sensation in this area. The other options are less likely to be responsible for the patient's symptoms based on the information provided."
693,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 51-year-old woman visits the emergency department with a 2-day history of swelling in her lower extremities. She doesn't feel any pain in her legs, but she's noticed that they're getting bigger and she's gaining weight. The patient has a history of morbid obesity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. The swelling started after she was prescribed a new medication to control her blood pressure, but she can't remember the name of the drug. Which of the following is most likely the mechanism of action of the medication that was prescribed to this patient?

Options:

A. The medication inhibits calcium channels in the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, leading to increased peripheral blood flow and reduced blood pressure.
B. The medication binds to hormone receptors in the body, altering the metabolism of fat and carbohydrates and leading to weight gain.
C. The medication acts as a potassium-sparing diuretic, increasing urine production and reducing fluid retention in the body.
D. The medication acts as a potassium-wasting diuretic, increasing urine production and reducing fluid retention in the body.

Answer: A. Inhibition of calcium channels"
694,"Question: A 23-year-old woman presents with ongoing diplopia for 1 week. She has noticed that her diplopia is more prominent when she looks at objects in her periphery. It does not present when looking straight ahead. She does not have a fever, headache, ocular pain, lacrimation, blurring of vision, or changes in her color vision. She is a college student and is otherwise healthy. The neurological examination reveals that when she looks to the left, her right eye does not adduct while her left eye abducts with nystagmus. Furthermore, when she looks to the right, her left eye does not adduct while her right eye abducts with prominent nystagmus. Her pupils are bilateral, equal, and reactive to light and accommodation. The convergence is normal. The rest of the cranial nerve examination is unremarkable. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?

A. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head: While a CT scan of the head may be useful in evaluating other causes of diplopia, such as a tumor or cerebral edema, it is unlikely to provide specific information about the underlying cause of the patient's diplopia given her symptoms and examination findings. Therefore, this option is not the next best step in the management of this patient.

B. Lumbar puncture: A lumbar puncture may be useful in evaluating for conditions such as meningitis or a spinal tumor, which could cause diplopia. However, given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it is unlikely that this procedure would provide significant diagnostic information.

C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain: MRI of the brain is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. MRI can help identify conditions such as a brain tumor, cerebral edema, or a structural abnormality that may be causing the patient's diplopia. Additionally, MRI can provide information about the extent of any abnormality and help guide further management.

D. Ophthalmology referral: While referral to ophthalmology may be appropriate to evaluate the patient's eye alignment and potential causes of diplopia, MRI of the brain is the most critical step in the management of this patient given the symptoms and examination findings. Ophthalmology referral can be considered once the underlying cause of the patient's diplopia has been identified."
695,"Question: A 26-year-old man presents to the emergency room with a complaint of lower abdominal pain that started about 5 hours ago. The pain was initially located around the umbilicus but later shifted to the right lower abdomen. It is a continuous dull, aching pain that does not radiate. He rates the severity of his pain as 7/10. He denies any previous history of similar symptoms. The vital signs include heart rate 100/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F), and blood pressure 114/77 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is severe right lower quadrant tenderness on palpation. Deep palpation of the left lower quadrant produces pain in the right lower quadrant. Rebound tenderness is present. The decision is made to place the patient on antibiotics and defer surgery. Two days later, his abdominal pain has worsened. Urgent computed tomography (CT) scan reveals new hepatic abscesses. The complete blood count result is given below:

Hemoglobin 16.2 mg/dL
Hematocrit 48%
Leukocyte count 15,000/mm³
Neutrophils 69%
Bands 3%
Eosinophils 1%
Basophils 0%
Lymphocytes 24%
Monocytes 3%
Platelet count 380,000/mm³

Which of the following complications has this patient most likely experienced?

A. Pylephlebitis
B. Intestinal obstruction
C. Perforation
D. Appendiceal abscess

Answer: A. Pylephlebitis

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of lower abdominal pain, tenderness on palpation, and new hepatic abscesses on CT scan are consistent with the complication of pylephlebitis. Pylephlebitis is a complication of appendicitis where there is inflammation of the appendicular veins, leading to the spread of infection to the liver and formation of hepatic abscesses. The patient's elevated white blood cell count and neutrophilia also support this diagnosis. Intestinal obstruction, perforation, and appendiceal abscess are less likely diagnoses given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results."
696,"Question: A 27-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. He was the unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. The patient is responding incoherently and is complaining of being in pain. He has several large lacerations and has been impaled with a piece of metal. IV access is unable to be obtained and a FAST exam is performed. His temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 90/48 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

A. Administer oral fluids: While oral fluids may be appropriate for hydration, it is not the best next step in management for this patient given his severe injuries and inability to take fluids orally.

B. Exploratory laparatomy: This option is not relevant to the patient's presentation and is not a necessary intervention at this time.

C. Obtain intraosseus access: Given the patient's unstable vital signs and the need for rapid administration of medications or fluids, obtaining intraosseus access is the best next step in management. This will allow for direct access to the patient's vascular system and enable prompt treatment.

D. Reattempt intravenous access: Given the patient's inability to take fluids orally and the unstable vital signs, attempting to obtain intravenous access again may be challenging and may result in further delay in treatment.

Answer: C. Obtain intraosseus access."
697,"Question: A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents due to a persistent dull headache beginning that morning. He has nausea and has vomited twice in the past four days, with left-sided ear pain and fever. However, his parents did not seek medical attention until now. He is from Thailand and is visiting his relatives in the United States for the summer. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. He is at the 45th percentile for height and 40th percentile for weight. He appears irritable. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 98/58 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Lateral gaze of the left eye is limited. The left tympanic membrane is erythematous with purulent discharge. There is no nuchal rigidity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Intravenous ceftriaxone and clindamycin therapy: This combination of antibiotics is appropriate for treating bacterial meningitis, which is a potential cause of the patient's symptoms.

B. Intravenous cefazolin and metronidazole therapy: This combination of antibiotics is also appropriate for treating bacterial meningitis, but it may not be as effective against the likely causative organism in this case, Streptococcus pneumoniae, as ceftriaxone and clindamycin are.

C. MRI of the brain: An MRI of the brain is not the most appropriate next step in management, as it is not diagnostic of bacterial meningitis and would not provide any information on the cause of the patient's symptoms.

D. Cranial burr hole evacuation: This is not a appropriate next step in management, as the patient does not have any signs of intracranial bleeding or other neurosurgical emergencies."
698,"Question: A 47-year-old woman presents to the physician with a sudden onset of repetitive tongue twisting and abnormal movements of the hands and legs, which started several days ago. She has a history of schizophrenia that has been well-controlled with fluphenazine for the past 2 years, but was recently switched to risperidone. Examination reveals protrusion of the tongue and smacking of the lips, as well as twisting movements of the arms and frequent tapping of the right foot. Based on these symptoms, which of the following conditions is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Cerebellar stroke - This condition involves a sudden loss of function in the cerebellum, which can cause a range of symptoms including difficulty with coordination, balance, and movement. However, the sudden onset of repetitive tongue twisting and abnormal movements in this patient do not suggest a cerebellar stroke.

B. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome - This is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect of antipsychotic medications, characterized by fever, muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability. While the patient's symptoms could be consistent with this condition, the presence of repetitive tongue twisting and abnormal movements of the hands and legs is more suggestive of tardive dyskinesia.

C. Akathisia - This is a less common side effect of antipsychotic medications, characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable urge to move. While the patient's restlessness and frequent tapping of the right foot could be consistent with akathisia, the repetitive tongue twisting and abnormal movements of the hands and legs are more typical of tardive dyskinesia.

D. Tardive dyskinesia - This is a chronic side effect of long-term use of antipsychotic medications, characterized by repetitive and involuntary movements of the face, tongue, and limbs. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this condition, which is likely triggered by the recent switch from fluphenazine to risperidone.

Answer: D. Tardive dyskinesia"
699,"Question: A 74-year-old woman presents to the physician with difficulty sleeping for several years, gradual decrease in sleep duration, and frequent awakenings during the night. How should the physician proceed?

Options:
A. Sleep restriction
B. Flurazepam
C. Reassurance
D. Paradoxical intention

Answer: C. Reassurance

Explanation: Based on the patient's symptoms, the most appropriate next step in management is to provide reassurance and support. The patient's difficulty sleeping and frequent awakenings are common symptoms of aging and can be managed with non-pharmacological interventions such as sleep restriction, relaxation techniques, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. While sleep medications such as flurazepam may be considered, they are not the first line of treatment for elderly patients with sleep disturbances. Paradoxical intention, which involves encouraging the patient to resist the urge to sleep, is not a recommended approach for elderly patients with sleep disturbances. Reassurance and support can help the patient address any underlying anxiety or depression that may be contributing to their sleep difficulties."
700,"Question: The patient's current symptoms are most likely caused by...

Options:
A. Antibiotic therapy - This is the most likely cause of the patient's current symptoms, as the patient has recently undergone surgery and is receiving antibiotic therapy for an infectious complication.

B. Coagulation cascade activation - While the patient's coagulation panel is within normal limits, the patient's history of intravenous drug use and alcohol abuse could lead to coagulation cascade activation, which could cause bleeding and bruising.

C. Bacterial infection of the bloodstream - The patient's symptoms of bleeding from the gums, oozing from the surgical sites, and recurrent epistaxis are consistent with a bacterial infection of the bloodstream, such as sepsis.

D. Factor VIII deficiency - This is an unlikely cause of the patient's symptoms, as there is no mention of a history of bleeding disorders or factor VIII deficiency in the patient's medical history.

Answer: A. Antibiotic therapy"
701,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A new study is investigating the effects of an experimental drug, Exerzisin, on the duration and intensity of exercise. In the treatment group, participants are given daily Exerzisin at the main treatment facility and instructed to exercise as much as they would like on the facility's exercise equipment. In contrast, the control group has free access to an outside, private gym. The duration and intensity of exercise in both groups is measured using a pedometer. The perceptive undergraduate, tasked with inputting all the data, notes that the treatment group may be more motivated to exercise harder and longer due to the fact that their exercising is observable by the investigators. To which type of bias is he alluding?

A. Selection bias (this option is not relevant to the given scenario)
B. Hawthorne effect (the correct answer)
C. Recall bias (this option is also not relevant to the given scenario)
D. Lead time bias (this option is also not relevant to the given scenario)

702,"Question: A 22-year-old woman visits the physician for a routine health checkup. No significant medical history is present. During the pelvic examination, a pink, 2 x 2 cm, fluctuant swelling is noticed at the right posterior vaginal introitus. Which of the following structures is most likely to be the source of this swelling?

A. Paraurethral glands
B. Greater vestibular glands
C. Mesonephric duct remnants
D. Sebaceous glands

Answer: B. Greater vestibular glands."
703,"Question: A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother who is concerned about his early sexual development. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. He is at the 99th percentile for height and 70th percentile for weight. His blood pressure is 115/78 mm Hg. Examination shows greasy facial skin and cystic acne on his forehead and back. There is coarse axillary and pubic hair. Serum studies show:

Cortisol (0800 h) 4 μg/dL
Deoxycorticosterone 2.5 ng/dL (N = 3.5–11.5)
Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 468 mcg/dL (N = 29–412)

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?

A. Deficiency of 21β-hydroxylase
B. Idiopathic overproduction of GnRH
C. Deficiency of 17α-hydroxylase
D. Deficiency of 11β-hydroxylase

Answer: A. Deficiency of 21β-hydroxylase

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms, including early sexual development and acne, are consistent with a deficiency of 21β-hydroxylase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the production of cortisol and androgens. The low cortisol level and high dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate level in the serum study suggest that the patient has a congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which is caused by a deficiency of 21β-hydroxylase. This condition can lead to the overproduction of GnRH, which can result in early sexual development and acne. The other options are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms."

705,"Question: A 29-year-old internal medicine resident presents to the emergency department with complaints of fevers, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and skin rash for 2 days. He feels fatigued and has lost his appetite. On further questioning, he says that he returned from his missionary trip to Brazil last week. He is excited as he talks about his trip. Besides a worthy clinical experience, he also enjoyed local outdoor activities, like swimming and rafting. His past medical history is insignificant. The blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 100/min, and the temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F). On examination, there is a rash on the legs. The rest of the examination is normal. Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible for this patient's condition?

A. Onchocerca volvulus: This parasite is not likely to cause the symptoms described in the patient's presentation. While Onchocerca volvulus can cause cutaneous manifestations such as rashes, it is more commonly associated with eye lesions and neurological symptoms.

B. Vibrio cholerae: Cholera is a bacterial infection that can cause diarrhea and dehydration, but it is not typically associated with fever, abdominal pain, or skin rash.

C. Schistosoma japonicum: Schistosoma japonicum is a parasitic infection that can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and skin rash. The patient's recent travel to Brazil increases the likelihood of this infection, as Schistosoma japonicum is common in many parts of South America.

D. Schistosoma mansoni: Schistosoma mansoni is another parasitic infection that can cause similar symptoms to Schistosoma japonicum, including fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and skin rash. Schistosoma mansoni is also common in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Brazil.

Answer: D. Schistosoma mansoni. The patient's recent travel to Brazil, combined with the symptoms he is experiencing, suggest that he may have contracted Schistosoma mansoni infection. This parasite is common in tropical and subtropical regions and can cause a range of symptoms, including those described in the patient's presentation."

708,"Question: A 4-year-old African-American girl is brought to the physician due to recurring bilateral leg pain lasting for 4 months. The pain is crampy in nature and occurs primarily before bedtime, with occasional waking up in tears due to severe pain. Massage by her mother provides temporary relief. She displays no pain while attending school or playing. Her mother has rheumatoid arthritis. Her vital signs are within normal limits, with a hemoglobin concentration of 12.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 10,900/mm3, and platelet count of 230,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Antinuclear antibody test: This test is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient's pain is not related to an autoimmune disorder, and the test would not provide any diagnostic value.

B. Pramipexole therapy: This medication is not appropriate for the patient's condition. Pramipexole is used to treat restless leg syndrome, which is characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the legs, usually during periods of rest or inactivity. The patient's symptoms do not match this condition.

C. X-ray of the lower extremities: An X-ray may be necessary to rule out any bone-related issues that could be causing the patient's pain. However, given the patient's age and the duration of her symptoms, a thorough physical examination and medical history should be conducted first to identify any underlying conditions.

D. Reassurance: Given the patient's age and the nature of her symptoms, it is likely that her pain is related to a musculoskeletal issue, such as overuse or strain. Providing reassurance and encouraging the patient to rest and avoid any activities that exacerbate the pain may be the most appropriate next step in management.

Answer: D. Reassurance."
709,"Question: A 49-year-old man presents to the clinic for evaluation of puncture wounds on the dorsal aspect of his right second and third metacarpals. He states that he was in a fight 3 nights ago and he struck another individual in the mouth. The patient’s medical history is significant for peripheral vascular disease and hypertension. He takes aspirin, sulfasalazine, and lisinopril. He is allergic to penicillin. He drinks socially on weekends and smokes one and one-half packs of cigarettes daily. Vitals of the patient are as follows: blood pressure is 142/88 mm Hg; heart rate is 88/min; respiratory rate is 14/min; temperature is 38.9°C (102.1°F). On physical examination, the patient appears alert and oriented. His BMI is 33 kg/m². His eyes are without scleral icterus. His right orbital region reveals ecchymosis along the superior and inferior borders. His heart is regular in rhythm and rate without murmurs. Capillary refill is 4 seconds in fingers and toes. His right dorsal second and third metacarpal region reveals two 3 mm lacerations with edema. Which of the following is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient?

A. Azithromycin with irrigation and debridement: While azithromycin is an appropriate antibiotic for treating soft tissue infections, it may not be the most appropriate choice for this patient given their history of allergies to penicillin.

B. Clindamycin plus doxycycline with irrigation and debridement: Clindamycin and doxycycline are both effective antibiotics against a wide range of bacteria, including those commonly associated with soft tissue infections. Additionally, the combination of these two antibiotics may help to cover any potential gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections.

C. Doxycycline with irrigation and debridement: Doxycycline is an effective antibiotic against a wide range of bacteria, including those commonly associated with soft tissue infections. However, it may not be the most appropriate choice for this patient given their history of allergies to penicillin.

D. Irrigation and debridement: While irrigation and debridement are important components of wound management, they may not be sufficient to treat a soft tissue infection on their own. The addition of antibiotics may be necessary to effectively treat the infection.

Answer: B. Clindamycin plus doxycycline with irrigation and debridement."
710,"Question: A 72-year-old male is brought from his nursing home to the emergency department for fever, chills, dyspnea, productive cough, and oliguria over the past 72 hours. He was in his normal state of health and slowly developed breathing problems and fever. His past medical history is significant for hepatitis C, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. His medications include bisoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin. Upon arrival to the ED, his blood pressure is 80/48 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, a respiratory rate of 28/min, and body temperature of 39.0°C (102.2°F). Physical examination reveals decreased breathing sounds in the base of the left lung, along with increased vocal resonance, and pan-inspiratory crackles. The abdomen is mildly distended with a positive fluid wave. The patient’s level of consciousness ranges from disoriented to drowsiness. He is transferred immediately to the ICU where vasoactive support is initiated. Laboratory tests show leukocytosis, neutrophilia with bands. Since admission 6 hours ago, the patient has remained anuric. Which of additional findings would you expect in this patient?

A. Urinary osmolality > 500 mOsmol/kg
B. Urinary osmolality < 350 mOsmol/kg
C. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN):Serum creatinine ratio (SCr) <15:1
D. Urine sodium > 40 mEq/L

Answer: C. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN):Serum creatinine ratio (SCr) <15:1

Explanation:

The patient's oliguria and anuric state suggest that there is significant kidney dysfunction. The BUN:SCr ratio is a useful marker of renal function, and a ratio of <15:1 indicates that the patient's kidneys are not able to concentrate the BUN (blood urea nitrogen) to the same degree as the serum creatinine, indicating severe renal impairment. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer."
711,"Question: A 59-year-old woman presents to the clinic complaining of an intermittent, gnawing epigastric pain that has been persisting for the past 2 months. The pain worsens with food intake and has been steadily increasing in severity. The patient denies any significant weight changes, nausea, vomiting, cough, or dyspepsia. Medical history reveals a history of chronic back pain for which she takes ibuprofen. Additionally, the patient's father passed away at the age of 55 due to pancreatic cancer. Laboratory results were unremarkable, except for a mild decrease in hemoglobin. Given these symptoms and medical history, which medication would be most appropriate to switch to at this time?

A. Acetaminophen: As the patient's pain is exacerbated by food intake and has been progressively worsening, acetaminophen may be a suitable option to switch to. Acetaminophen is known to help alleviate gastrointestinal discomfort and may provide relief for the patient's epigastric pain.

B. Aspirin: Aspirin is an alternative medication that could be considered, as it has anti-inflammatory properties and may help reduce the patient's pain. However, it is important to note that aspirin can irritate the stomach and increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may worsen the patient's symptoms.

C. Omeprazole: Given the patient's history of gastrointestinal issues and the presence of epigastric pain, omeprazole may be a suitable option to switch to. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that can help reduce inflammation in the stomach and alleviate symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

D. Ranitidine: Ranitidine is another option to consider, as it is also a proton pump inhibitor that can help reduce inflammation in the stomach and alleviate symptoms of GERD. However, ranitidine may not be the best choice for this patient, as it has a slower onset of action compared to omeprazole and may not provide immediate relief for the patient's symptoms."
712,"Question: A 29-year-old G1P0 woman, at 12 weeks estimated gestational age, presents for her first prenatal visit. Past medical history reveals the patient has type O+ blood and that her husband has type A+ blood. The patient is worried about the risk of her baby having hemolytic disease. Which of the following is correct regarding fetomaternal incompatibility in this patient?

Options:
A. It cannot affect firstborns - Incorrect. Fetomaternal incompatibility can affect firstborns, as it is a condition where the mother's blood type is incompatible with the fetus's blood type, which can lead to hemolytic disease in the newborn.
B. Prenatal detection is very important because fetomaternal incompatibility is associated with severe fetal anemia - Correct. Prenatal detection of fetomaternal incompatibility is important because it can help identify the risk of severe fetal anemia and take appropriate measures to prevent it.
C. A direct Coombs test is strongly positive - Incorrect. A direct Coombs test is not a reliable test for detecting fetomaternal incompatibility.
D. It is a rare cause of newborn hemolytic disease - Correct. Fetomaternal incompatibility is a rare cause of newborn hemolytic disease, which is a condition where the newborn's red blood cells are destroyed due to incompatibility between the mother's and father's blood types."
713,"Question: A 4-month-old male infant is brought in because he rejects food and is losing weight. He had several upper respiratory tract infections during the last 2 months. Upon examination, hepatosplenomegaly is noted, as well as mild hypotonia. During the next few weeks, hepatosplenomegaly progresses, the boy fails to thrive, and he continues to reject food. He has a blood pressure of 100/70 mm Hg and heart rate of 84/min. Blood tests show pancytopenia and elevated levels of transaminases. Slit lamp examination shows bilateral cherry-red spots on the macula. Chest X-ray shows a reticulonodular pattern and calcified nodules. Biopsy of the liver shows foamy histiocytes. What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I
B. Niemann-Pick disease type A
C. Gaucher disease
D. Gilbert syndrome

Answer: B. Niemann-Pick disease type A

The patient's symptoms of hepatosplenomegaly, mild hypotonia, and pancytopenia, along with the elevated transaminase levels and bilateral cherry-red spots on the macula, are highly suggestive of Niemann-Pick disease type A. This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the sphingolipid metabolism, leading to accumulation of lipids in the liver, spleen, and other organs. The biopsy findings of foamy histiocytes also support this diagnosis. Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I, Gaucher disease, and Gilbert syndrome are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's presentation."
714,"Question:
A 3-month-old African American infant presents to the hospital with 2 days of fever, ""coke""-colored urine, and jaundice. The pregnancy was uneventful except the infant was found to have hyperbilirubinemia that was treated with phototherapy. The mother explains that she breastfeeds her child and recently was treated herself for a UTI with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Which of the following diseases is similarly inherited as the disease experienced by the child?

Options:
A. Marfan syndrome - This is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, which provides support to various organs and structures throughout the body, including the heart, blood vessels, and joints. Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene and can cause a range of symptoms including tall stature, thin or weak muscles, and aortic root dilatation.

B. Sickle cell anemia - This is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. Sickle cell anemia is caused by mutations in the HBB gene and can cause anemia, infections, and other complications.

C. Hemophilia A - This is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to clot blood, leading to prolonged bleeding after injury or surgery. Hemophilia A is caused by mutations in the F8 gene and can cause joint pain and swelling, muscle weakness, and prolonged bleeding.

D. Beta thalassemia - This is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, similar to sickle cell anemia. Beta thalassemia is caused by mutations in the HBB gene and can cause anemia, fatigue, and other complications.

Answer: C. Hemophilia A.

Explanation: The mother's history of being treated for a UTI with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) increases the likelihood that the child may have inherited a genetic disorder related to blood clotting, such as hemophilia A. This is because TMP-SMX has been associated with an increased risk of birth defects, including genetic disorders, in offspring. Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to clot blood, and it is caused by mutations in the F8 gene, which is the same gene that is affected in the mother's UTI treatment. Therefore, it is possible that the child may have inherited the mutated gene from the mother, leading to hemophilia A."
715,"Question: An 11-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of frequent falling. His mother reports that the patient has had increased difficulty walking over the last few months and has refused to eat solid foods for the past 2 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones. The patient has had multiple ear infections since birth. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Examination shows foot inversion with hammertoes bilaterally. His gait is wide-based with irregular and uneven steps. Laboratory studies show a serum glucose concentration of 300 mg/dL.

Question: An 11-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of frequent falling. His mother reports that the patient has had increased difficulty walking over the last few months and has refused to eat solid foods for the past 2 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones. The patient has had multiple ear infections since birth. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Examination shows foot inversion with hammertoes bilaterally. His gait is wide-based with irregular and uneven steps. Laboratory studies show a serum glucose concentration of 300 mg/dL. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?

A. Expansion of GAA trinucleotide repeats: The patient's symptoms of difficulty walking and refusal to eat solid foods, along with the finding of foot inversion and hammertoes, are consistent with a diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which is a genetic disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system. The patient's elevated serum glucose concentration is likely a result of the underlying metabolic dysfunction associated with the disease. The expansion of GAA trinucleotide repeats is a common genetic mutation associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

B. Absence of dystrophin protein: Dystrophin is a protein that is important for muscle structure and function. The absence of this protein is a hallmark of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that affects muscle strength and function. The patient's symptoms of difficulty walking and refusal to eat solid foods, along with the finding of foot inversion and hammertoes, are consistent with a diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

C. Duplication of PMP22 gene: The PMP22 gene is responsible for the production of a protein that is important for myelin sheath formation in the peripheral nervous system. Duplication of this gene is associated with a form of hereditary neuropathy called Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The patient's symptoms of difficulty walking and refusal to eat solid foods, along with the finding of foot inversion and hammertoes, are consistent with a diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

D. Defect of ATM protein: ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) is a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability. A defect in this protein is associated with ataxia-telangiectasia, a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and immune system. The patient's symptoms of difficulty walking and refusal to eat solid foods, along with the finding of foot inversion and hammertoes, are not consistent with a diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia."
716,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 61-year-old G4P3 presents with a 5-year history of involuntary urine loss on coughing, sneezing, and physical exertion. She denies urine leakage at night. She has been menopausal since 51 years of age. She is otherwise healthy and is not on any medications, including hormone replacement therapy. The weight is 78 kg (172 lb) and the height is 156 cm (5.1 ft). The vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows no costovertebral angle tenderness. The neurologic examination is unremarkable. The gynecologic examination revealed pale and thin vulvar and vaginal mucosa. The external urethral opening appears normal; there is urine leakage when the patient is asked to cough. The Q-tip test is positive. The bimanual exam reveals painless bulging of the anterior vaginal wall. Which of the following findings are most likely to be revealed by cystometry?

A. Normal residual volume, no involuntary detrusor contractions
B. Normal residual volume, involuntary detrusor contractions on minimal bladder filling
C. Increased residual volume, involuntary detrusor contractions on maximal bladder filling
D. Normal residual volume, involuntary detrusor contractions on both minimal and maximal bladder filling

Answer: D. Normal residual volume, no involuntary detrusor contractions."
717,"Question: A 26-year-old African-American woman visits the clinic for a routine check-up. Review of systems reveals that she experiences nervousness and has recently developed a slight tremor. Additionally, she has lost 15 pounds in the past 3 months despite increased appetite. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/78 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On physical exam, her skin is warm and she displays mild exophthalmos. Which of the following is the direct cause of the patient's ophthalmologic findings?

A. Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies
B. Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies
C. Lymphocytic infiltration
D. Anti-myelin antibodies

Answer: C. Lymphocytic infiltration

Explanation: The patient's ophthalmologic findings, including mild exophthalmos, are likely caused by lymphocytic infiltration, which is a direct mechanism that can lead to inflammation and damage to the eye. The other options, anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, and anti-myelin antibodies, are indirect mechanisms that can also contribute to ophthalmologic findings, but are not the direct cause of the patient's symptoms in this case."
718,"Question: A patient of yours has been hospitalized for a week with pneumonia. You have taken care of them while they were in the hospital. At the end of their hospitalization, they give you a small gift basket with homemade food and a $250 gift certificate to an expensive restaurant. Which of the following is an appropriate response to this situation?

Options:
A. Return both the food and gift certificate because it is never acceptable to take gifts from patients.
B. Keep both the food and gift certificate.
C. Keep the food, but return the gift certificate.
D. Return the gift certificate for cash, and donate the cash to the hospital's free clinic.

Answer: C. Keep the food, but return the gift certificate.

As a healthcare provider, it is important to maintain a professional boundary with patients, and accepting gifts from patients can blur this boundary. While it may seem impolite to return the gift certificate, it is important to prioritize maintaining a professional relationship with your patient. Keeping the food and returning the gift certificate is an appropriate response in this situation.

It is also worth noting that accepting gifts from patients can create a conflict of interest and may be seen as unethical. By returning the gift certificate, you are demonstrating your commitment to maintaining a professional relationship with your patient and upholding ethical standards.

In contrast, keeping both the food and the gift certificate may be seen as accepting favors in exchange for medical care, which could compromise the patient's trust in your professionalism and the integrity of your medical practice.

Finally, returning the gift certificate for cash and donating the cash to the hospital's free clinic may not be practical or feasible, as it may not be possible to determine the origin of the gift certificate or ensure that it is used for its intended purpose.

In conclusion, returning the gift certificate is the most appropriate response in this situation, as it maintains a professional boundary with the patient, upholds ethical standards, and avoids any potential conflicts of interest."
719,"Question: A young infant is brought to an immunologist because of recurrent infections, which have not resolved despite appropriate medical treatment. On reviewing her medical history, the immunologist notes that the child has had frequent disseminated mycobacterial infections. He suspects a possible immunodeficiency. What is the most likely cause of this patient's immunodeficiency?

Options:

A. B-cell maturation defect: This option is incorrect because a B-cell maturation defect would not lead to a disseminated mycobacterial infection. B cells are important for the humoral immune response, but they are not directly involved in the early stages of mycobacterial infection.

B. ATM gene defect: This option is incorrect because an ATM gene defect is not associated with immunodeficiency. The ATM gene is involved in the regulation of cellular responses to DNA damage, but it is not related to the immune system.

C. Interferon-gamma signaling defect: This is the most likely cause of the patient's immunodeficiency. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the immune response to mycobacteria. A defect in IFN-γ signaling can lead to a decreased ability to control mycobacterial infections, resulting in recurrent and severe infections.

D. BTK gene defect: This option is incorrect because a BTK gene defect is not associated with immunodeficiency. The BTK gene encodes for the Bruton's tyrosine kinase, which is involved in the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, but it is not related to the immune response to mycobacteria.

Answer: C. Interferon-gamma signaling defect."
720,"Question: A 2-year-old male is brought to his pediatrician by his mother because of abdominal pain and blood in the stool. Scintigraphy reveals uptake in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Persistence of which of the following structures is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

Options:
A. Urachus
B. Omphalomesenteric duct
C. Paramesonephric duct
D. Ureteric bud

Answer: B. Omphalomesenteric duct

Explanation: The omphalomesenteric duct is a persistent embryological structure that is present in approximately 75% of individuals. It is a remnant of the yolk sac and is located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. The omphalomesenteric duct is a potential cause of abdominal pain and blood in the stool in young children. It is important to evaluate the patient's symptoms and medical history to determine the likelihood of an omphalomesenteric duct persistence. Imaging studies such as ultrasound or CT scan can help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment options may include observation, antibiotics, or surgical intervention depending on the severity of the condition."
721,"Question: A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to a generalized pruritic rash that has been present for 14 hours. He has a history of pink eyes that resolved spontaneously 5 days ago, and he has acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has been treated with 3 cycles of chemotherapy, including vincristine, asparaginase, dexamethasone, and doxorubicin. His last treatment cycle was 2 weeks ago. The patient's other medications include multivitamin supplements. His vital signs are: temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), pulse of 90 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 105/65 mm Hg. Examination of the skin shows multiple crops of macules and papules on the face, trunk, and extremities, as well as excoriation marks and crusted lesions. What is the most appropriate next step in the patient's treatment?

A. Administration of immunoglobulin
B. Symptomatic therapy
C. Acyclovir administration
D. Penicillin V administration

Answer: C. Acyclovir administration

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of a generalized pruritic rash and excoriation marks are consistent with a viral exanthemata, such as hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Acyclovir is the most appropriate antiviral medication to consider in this case, as it is effective against HFMD caused by enteroviruses, which are the most common cause of viral exanthemata in children. Immunoglobulin administration may be considered in cases of HFMD, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient, as it is not effective against enteroviruses and may not provide significant benefit in this case. Symptomatic therapy, such as antihistamines or corticosteroids, may provide some relief of symptoms, but it will not treat the underlying viral infection. Penicillin V is not effective against viral infections and is not the appropriate choice for this patient."
722,"Question: A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset right hand and right leg weakness. The patient was at home cleaning when his symptoms began. He also complains of diffuse and severe pain throughout his entire body which he states he has experienced before. The patient is an immigrant from South America, and his medical history is not known. His temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 128/67 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. CT of the head demonstrates no bleeding. Physical exam is notable for 2/5 strength in the patient's right arm and right leg. Which of the following is the best management in this patient?

A. Aspirin: Aspirin is not the best management option for this patient. Aspirin is an anti-platelet medication that is used to prevent blood clots, but it is not effective in treating acute ischemic stroke or TIA (transient ischemic attack) symptoms.

B. Exchange transfusion: Exchange transfusion is the best management option for this patient. This patient is experiencing a TIA or acute ischemic stroke, which can cause sudden weakness or numbness in the face, arm, or leg, along with severe headache and confusion. Exchange transfusion is a medical procedure that involves replacing the patient's whole blood with donated blood or a hemodilution solution to improve blood flow to the brain and reduce the risk of further damage.

C. Heparin: Heparin is not the best management option for this patient. Heparin is an anticoagulant medication that is used to prevent blood clots, but it is not effective in treating acute ischemic stroke or TIA symptoms.

D. Morphine and IV fluids: Morphine and IV fluids may be used to manage the patient's pain and hydration status, but they are not the best management option for treating a TIA or acute ischemic stroke.

Answer: B. Exchange transfusion"
723,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 6-year-old male is brought to the pediatrician by his mother due to concerns about his breathing. She mentions that he has occasional bouts of coughing without any significant difficulty breathing. The pediatrician wants to rule out asthma as a diagnosis and orders a test to confirm. Which of the following tests does the pediatrician choose?

A. Methacholine challenge test: This test is used to measure the airway responsiveness of the lungs and can help determine if a child has asthma. During the test, the child is given a small dose of methacholine, a medication that can cause the airways to constrict, and their breathing is monitored for any changes.

B. CT scan: A computed tomography (CT) scan is a diagnostic imaging test that uses X-rays to produce detailed cross-sectional images of the body. While a CT scan can help identify any structural abnormalities in the lungs, it is not typically used to diagnose asthma.

C. Chest X-ray: A chest X-ray is an imaging test that uses X-rays to produce pictures of the inside of the chest and lungs. While a chest X-ray can help identify any structural abnormalities in the lungs, it may not be able to detect asthma.

D. Allergy testing: Allergy testing is used to determine if a child has an allergy to a particular substance. While allergies can contribute to asthma symptoms, allergy testing is not directly related to diagnosing asthma."

725,"Question: A 20-year-old woman presents with chest pain for the last 20 minutes, describing a ""squeezing"" sensation in the chest and a racing heart. She took aspirin before coming to the hospital, and similar symptoms occurred 5 days ago but resolved within 10 minutes. Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse of 110/min, respiratory rate of 28/min, and blood pressure of 136/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient appears fidgety and restless. An echocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus tachycardia but is otherwise normal. Which of the following is the next best step in treatment of this patient?

A. Alprazolam: While the patient's anxiety and agitation may be contributing to her discomfort, alprazolam is not the most appropriate medication for treating chest pain or heart attack symptoms.

B. Nitroglycerin: Nitroglycerin is a medication commonly used to treat chest pain or angina, but it is not necessary in this case as the patient's ECG shows sinus tachycardia, which is a normal heart rhythm.

C. Buspirone: Buspirone is an anxiolytic medication that may be useful in managing the patient's anxiety, but it is not the best choice for treating chest pain or heart attack symptoms.

D. Sertraline: Sertraline is an antidepressant that may be effective in managing the patient's anxiety, but it is not the best choice for treating chest pain or heart attack symptoms.

Answer: A. Alprazolam."
726,"Question: Forty minutes after undergoing nasal polypectomy for refractory rhinitis, a 48-year-old woman develops chest tightness and shortness of breath. The surgical course was uncomplicated and the patient was successfully extubated. She received ketorolac for postoperative pain. She has a history of asthma, hypertension, and aspirin allergy. Her daily medications include metoprolol and lisinopril. Examination shows a flushed face. Chest auscultation reveals wheezes and decreased breath sounds in both lung fields. An ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction: This is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms, as she has a history of asthma and aspirin allergy, which suggests that she has a true allergic reaction.

B. Prinzmetal angina: This is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with an allergic reaction than with Prinzmetal angina, which is a coronary artery disorder.

C. Pseudoallergic reaction: This is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. A pseudoallergic reaction is an immune-mediated reaction that mimics an allergic reaction but does not involve the immune system. The patient's history of asthma and aspirin allergy, along with the symptoms she is experiencing, are consistent with a pseudoallergic reaction.

D. Excessive beta-adrenergic blockade: This is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms, as the patient's medication regimen does not include any beta-blockers.

Answer: C. Pseudoallergic reaction."
727,"Question: A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to a 1-day history of fever and disorientation. His wife reports that he had abdominal pain and diarrhea the previous day. He drinks 60 oz of alcohol weekly. His pulse is 110/min and blood pressure is 96/58 mm Hg. Examination shows jaundice, palmar erythema, spider nevi on his chest, dilated veins on the anterior abdominal wall, and 2+ edema of the lower extremities. The abdomen is soft and diffusely tender; there is shifting dullness to percussion. His albumin is 1.4 g/dL, bilirubin is 5 mg/dL, and prothrombin time is 31 seconds (INR = 3.3). Hepatitis serology is negative. A CT scan of the abdomen is shown. Which of the following processes is the most likely explanation for these findings?

A. Accumulation of iron in hepatocytes: Inaccurate. The CT scan does not show any evidence of iron accumulation in the liver.

B. Ground-glass hepatocytes with cytotoxic T cells: Inaccurate. The CT scan shows a diffuse increase in the density of the hepatic parenchyma, without any evidence of ground-glass hepatocytes or cytotoxic T cells.

C. Fibrous bands surrounding regenerating hepatocytes: Correct. The CT scan shows the presence of fibrous bands surrounding the regenerating hepatocytes, which is a common finding in liver cirrhosis.

D. Misfolded protein aggregates in hepatocellular endoplasmic reticulum: Inaccurate. The CT scan does not show any evidence of misfolded protein aggregates in the hepatocellular endoplasmic reticulum.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms and findings is liver cirrhosis, which is characterized by the deposition of fibrous bands around regenerating hepatocytes."
728,"Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of fatigue after returning from visiting family in South Africa. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?

Options:
A. Folic acid therapy
B. Oral succimer
C. Reassurance
D. Iron supplementation

Answer: C. Reassurance

Explanation:

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is iron deficiency anemia. However, since the patient's symptoms have improved with acetaminophen, it is unlikely that the anemia is severe enough to require immediate treatment. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to provide reassurance to the parents and monitor the patient's condition closely for any further changes.

Option A, folic acid therapy, is not appropriate as folic acid is not effective in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia.

Option B, oral succimer, is not a commonly used treatment for iron deficiency anemia and may have potential side effects, so it is not the best option.

Option D, iron supplementation, may be considered in the future if the patient's anemia persists or worsens, but it is not necessary at this time."
729,"Question: A 27-year-old G2P1 female gives birth to a baby girl at 33 weeks gestation. The child is somnolent with notable difficulty breathing. Pulse pressure is widened. She is profusely cyanotic. Auscultation is notable for a loud single S2. An echocardiogram demonstrates an enlarged heart and further studies show blood from the left ventricle entering the pulmonary circulation as well as the systemic circulation. Which of the following processes was most likely abnormal in this patient?

Options:

A. Closure of an aorticopulmonary shunt: This option is incorrect because the echocardiogram did not demonstrate any evidence of a patent ductus arteriosus, which is the condition that would be expected if the aorticopulmonary shunt had closed.

B. Formation of the interatrial septum: This option is incorrect because the patient's cyanosis and pulse pressure widening are more consistent with a left-to-right shunt, which would be caused by a patent foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect.

C. Spiraling of the truncal and bulbar ridges: This option is incorrect because there is no mention of any abnormalities in the patient's cranial or facial structure.

D. Formation of the aorticopulmonary septum: This is the correct answer. The echocardiogram demonstrated an enlarged heart with blood from the left ventricle entering both the pulmonary and systemic circulations, which is consistent with a patent aorticopulmonary septum. This is a congenital heart defect that allows blood to flow from the left ventricle directly into the pulmonary artery, bypassing the lungs and resulting in excessive pulmonary blood flow and cyanosis."

732,"Question: A 27-year-old Asian woman presents to her primary care physician with joint pain and a headache. She has had intermittent joint and muscle pain for the past several months in the setting of a chronic headache. She states that the pain seems to migrate from joint to joint, and her muscles typically ache making it hard for her to sleep. The patient's past medical history is non-contributory, and she is currently taking ibuprofen for joint pain. Physical exam is notable for an asymmetrical pulse in the upper extremities. The patient has lost 10 pounds since her previous visit 2 months ago. Laboratory values are notable for an elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

A. Anti-dsDNA level: This is not a relevant test for the patient's symptoms, as anti-dsDNA antibodies are typically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient does not have any other symptoms suggestive of this condition.

B. Methotrexate: Methotrexate is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) that is commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, it may not be the best option for the patient's symptoms, as the patient has not been diagnosed with any inflammatory condition.

C. Prednisone: Prednisone is a corticosteroid that can be used to reduce inflammation and swelling in the body. It may be a good option for the patient's symptoms, as the laboratory values suggest an inflammatory state.

D. Temporal artery biopsy: This is an invasive procedure that involves taking a sample of tissue from the temporal artery to examine for signs of inflammation or autoimmune disorders. It may be necessary if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen over time, but it is not a necessary step in the initial management of the patient's symptoms.

Answer: C. Prednisone."
733,"Question: A 16-year-old girl with a history of bipolar disorder presents to the emergency department 1 week after starting a new medication, complaining of a painful, blistering rash. What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?

Options:

A. Topiramate
B. Valproic acid
C. Lamotrigine
D. Lithium

Answer: C. Lamotrigine

Explanation: Lamotrigine is a common culprit in drug-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe and life-threatening adverse drug reaction characterized by a painful, blistering rash with epidermal detachment. The patient's history of bipolar disorder and the presence of hemorrhagic erosions on the hard palate and buccal mucosa further support the diagnosis. Topiramate, valproic acid, and lithium are less likely to cause this type of reaction."
734,"Question: A 72-year-old man is brought to the clinic by his daughter due to increasing confusion. The daughter reports that over the past two weeks, the patient has been experiencing episodes where he appears to be staring off into space, forgetting why he entered a room. She is also concerned about his balance, as he has had several falls, including a recent one three weeks ago while getting the mail. The patient denies any symptoms of loss of consciousness, pre-syncope, chest pain, palpitations, urinary incontinence, or bowel incontinence. He does complain of headaches but denies dizziness. He has experienced nausea and non-bloody emesis on several occasions but denies abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea. The patient has a significant medical history, including atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. He takes aspirin, warfarin, insulin, lisinopril, simvastatin, and ibuprofen. He drinks a half glass of whisky after dinner every night and smokes a cigar on the weekends. On physical examination, the patient is oriented to name and place but not to date, and is unable to spell ""world"" backward. When asked to recall three words, he can only remember two. There are no motor or sensory deficits.

Options:

A. Alzheimer's disease: This is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms of confusion, memory loss, and difficulty with orientation. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior.

B. Ischemic stroke: This is a less likely diagnosis, as the patient does not have any sudden onset of weakness or numbness on one side of the body, which is a common symptom of ischemic stroke. However, the patient's history of falls and recent head injury could suggest a higher risk of cerebrovascular disease.

C. Subdural hematoma: This is a less likely diagnosis, as the patient does not have any sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, or loss of consciousness, which are common symptoms of subdural hematoma. However, the patient's history of falls and recent head injury could suggest a higher risk of this condition.

D. Vitamin B12 deficiency: This is an unlikely diagnosis, as the patient does not have any symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, such as fatigue, weakness, or neurological symptoms. Vitamin B12 deficiency is more commonly seen in older adults who have a vegetarian diet or who have malabsorption."
735,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: An 18-year-old man with a known peanut allergy unknowingly consumes biscuits contaminated with trace amounts of peanuts, leading to a severe allergic reaction within 15 minutes. He experiences generalized redness of the skin, urticaria, shortness of breath, and wheezing, along with low blood pressure (80/55 mm Hg) and a rapid heart rate (124/min). He is administered intramuscular epinephrine and rushed to the nearby hospital. Based on the patient's symptoms and reaction time, which of the following hypersensitivity reactions is most likely to have occurred?

Options:
A. Immediate hypersensitivity - This type of hypersensitivity reaction occurs within minutes to hours of exposure to an allergen, and is characterized by rapid onset and severe symptoms.
B. Type II hypersensitivity - Also known as cytotoxic hypersensitivity, this reaction occurs when the body's immune system produces antibodies that attack and destroy its own tissues, leading to cellular damage and organ dysfunction.
C. Serum sickness - This is a type of delayed-onset hypersensitivity reaction that occurs 1-2 days after exposure to an allergen, and is characterized by fever, joint pain, and skin rash.
D. Contact dermatitis - This is a type of skin reaction that occurs when the skin comes into contact with an allergen or irritant, leading to redness, itching, and inflammation.

Answer: A. Immediate hypersensitivity"
736,"Question: An 81-year-old male patient presents to his primary care physician with a 4-month history of shortness of breath, fatigue, and increased coughing with more sputum production. He also mentions gaining weight over the past 6 months. His medical history includes hypertension and diabetes, and he has a 40 pack-year smoking history. On physical examination, he has cyanotic appearance with 1+ edema in his legs bilaterally, wheezing on lung auscultation with a prolonged expiratory phase. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on a chest radiograph in this patient?

A. Calcified pleural plaques surrounding the diaphragm
B. Cardiomegaly and increased bronchial markings
C. Hyperinflated lungs and loss of lung markings
D. Perihilar mass with unilateral hilar enlargement

Answer: B. Cardiomegaly and increased bronchial markings

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, fatigue, and coughing with increased sputum production, along with the physical examination findings of cyanotic appearance and edema in the legs, suggest that the patient may have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A chest radiograph is likely to reveal cardiomegaly, which is an enlargement of the heart due to the increased workload on the heart as a result of the lung disease. In addition, there may be increased bronchial markings on the chest radiograph, which are signs of chronic inflammation in the airways. Hyperinflated lungs and loss of lung markings are more consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a different condition than COPD. Perihilar mass with unilateral hilar enlargement is less likely in this case, as it is more commonly seen in lung cancer or tuberculosis."
737,"Question: A 66-year-old man is transferred to your hospital after 3 days of progressively severe headache, vomiting, low-grade fever, and confusion. According to his partner, the patient has been dealing with some memory loss and complaining about headaches for the past 2 weeks. He has a history of interstitial pulmonary disease that required lung transplantation 2 years ago. Upon admission, he is found with a blood pressure of 160/100 mm Hg, a pulse of 58/min, a respiratory rate of 15/min, and a body temperature of 36°C (97°F). During the examination, he is found with oral thrush and symmetric and reactive pupils; there are no focal neurological signs or papilledema. A lumbar puncture is performed. Which of the following features would be expected to be found in this case?

A. Aspect: xanthochromic, opening pressure: normal, cell count: ↑ red blood cells, protein: normal, glucose: normal

The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that he may have developed a central nervous system (CNS) infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis. A cloudy lumbar puncture with an elevated opening pressure, an increase in lymphocytes, and a decrease in glucose levels would be consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Aspect: cloudy, opening pressure: ↑, cell count: ↑ lymphocytes, protein: ↑, glucose: ↓."
738,"Question: A 44-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for worsening dysuria, hematuria, and lower abdominal pain. Her symptoms began approximately 2 days ago and have progressively worsened. She denies headache, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She endorses feeling ""feverish"" and notes to having foul smelling urine. She has a past medical history of Romano-Ward syndrome and is not on any treatment. She experiences profuse diarrhea and nausea when taking carbapenems and develops a severe rash with cephalosporins. Her temperature is 100.4°F (38C), blood pressure is 138/93 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, the patient appears uncomfortable and there is tenderness to palpation around the bilateral flanks and costovertebral angle. A urinalysis and urine culture is obtained and appropriate antibiotics are administered. On her next clinical visit urine studies and a basic metabolic panel is obtained, which is shown below:

Serum:
Na+: 140 mEq/L
Cl-: 101 mEq/L
K+: 4.2 mEq/L
HCO3-: 22 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 94 mg/dL
Creatinine: 2.4 mg/dL

Urinalysis
Color: Yellow
Appearance: Clear
Blood: Negative
pH: 7 (Normal 5-8)
Protein: Negative
Nitrite: Negative
Leukocyte esterase: Negative
Cast: Epithelial casts
FeNa: 3%

Urine culture
Preliminary report: 10,000 CFU/mL E. coli

Which of the following antibiotics was most likely given to this patient?

D. Tobramycin

Explanation: Based on the patient's symptoms and urinalysis results, the most likely antibiotic given to the patient is tobramycin. Tobramycin is effective against E. coli, which is the preliminary culture report of the urine. Additionally, tobramycin is a aminoglycoside antibiotic, which is commonly used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by E. coli. Clindamycin is also effective against E. coli, but it is not the most likely choice based on the patient's medical history of Romano-Ward syndrome and the presence of epithelial casts in the urine. Aztreonam is effective against Gram-negative bacteria, but it is not the most likely choice for a UTI caused by E. coli. Levofloxacin is effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but it is not the most likely choice for a UTI caused by E. coli."
739,"Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother due to a large head contusion and altered mental status. The mother initially states that the injury occurred when a ""pot fell from a shelf onto his head,"" but later changes the story to ""tripping over a football."" Physical examination reveals cracks in the suture lines of the skull and a flattened appearance to the bone. The father arrives to inquire about the patient's recovery, but the parents refuse to allow a solo interview. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

Options:

A. Child abuse - The mother's inconsistent stories and the parents' refusal to allow a solo interview suggest that the injury may have been intentionally inflicted, making child abuse the most likely diagnosis.

B. Cranioschisis - This rare congenital disorder causes abnormal growth and development of the skull, leading to cracks in the suture lines and a flattened appearance to the bone.

C. Osteogenesis imperfecta - This genetic disorder causes fragile bones and can result in fractures and deformities, including those seen in the patient's skull.

D. Rickets - A vitamin D-deficient condition that can cause softening of the bones and fractures, particularly in young children.

Answer: A. Child abuse"
740,"Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician due to a 5-day history of sore throat and a painful swelling on the left side of his neck that has become progressively larger. He has had pain during swallowing and has refused to eat solid foods for the past 3 days. He immigrated to the United States one year ago from India. His immunization records are unavailable. His family keeps 2 cats as pets. He appears well. He is at the 60th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), pulse is 103/min, and blood pressure is 92/60 mm Hg. The oropharynx is erythematous; the tonsils are enlarged with exudates. There is a 3-cm warm, tender, nonfluctuant cervical lymph node on the left side of the neck. His hemoglobin is 12.6 g/dL, leukocyte count is 11,100/mm3, and platelet count is 180,000/mm3. In addition to obtaining a throat swab and culture, the most appropriate next step in management is:

C. Clindamycin therapy.

The patient's symptoms, including the swollen neck and tender cervical lymph node, suggest a possibility of abscess or cellulitis. Clindamycin is an antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacterial pathogens, including streptococci and staphylococci, which are common causes of abscess and cellulitis. Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine therapy may be effective against other types of bacterial infections, but they may not be as effective against the likely causative organisms in this case. Incision and drainage may be considered if the abscess is causing significant discomfort or if there are signs of sepsis, but it may not be necessary in the absence of these signs. Immunoglobulin therapy is not typically used to treat bacterial infections."
741,"Question: A pharmaceutical company conducts a randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of their new anticoagulant drug, Aclotsaban, with the current standard of care in preventing thrombotic events following total knee arthroplasty. However, a significant number of patients drop out or fail to complete the treatment according to their assigned study arm. Despite this, the results for the patients who completed the course of Aclotsaban appear promising. Which of the following methods would be most suitable to demonstrate the superiority of Aclotsaban?

A. Per-protocol analysis
B. Intention-to-treat analysis
C. Sub-group analysis
D. Non-inferiority analysis

Answer: B. Intention-to-treat analysis

Explanation: In this scenario, the most appropriate method to use would be intention-to-treat analysis. This is because the study was designed to compare the effectiveness of Aclotsaban with the current standard of care, and the patients were randomly assigned to their respective study arms. However, some patients may have dropped out or failed to complete the treatment according to their assigned arm, which could lead to biased results if not accounted for. Intention-to-treat analysis takes into account the treatment assignments as randomized, regardless of whether the patients completed the treatment or not. This method ensures that the results are more representative of the population and provides a more accurate comparison between the two treatment groups."
742,"Sure! Here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 67-year-old man presents to the emergency department with difficulty urinating. He has been experiencing this symptom for a while, but it has become more pronounced recently. He has to put in a lot of effort to start urinating, and he is unable to completely empty his bladder. He also has suprapubic tenderness. These symptoms started suddenly 3 days ago. The patient has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia, constipation, and diabetes mellitus. He is currently taking finasteride, sodium docusate, hydrochlorothiazide, and phenylephrine for seasonal allergies. His last bowel movement was 2 days ago. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 167/98 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Physical exam reveals suprapubic tenderness, and an ultrasound shows 750 mL of fluid in the bladder. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. Constipation
B. Medication-induced symptoms
C. Prostatic adenocarcinoma
D. Worsening benign prostatic hyperplasia

743,"Question: A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of fever and shortness of breath. He has a history of COPD treated with inhaled albuterol and his vital signs are as follows: temperature 39.0°C (102.2°F), pulse 95/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg. On cardiopulmonary examination, there are decreased breath sounds and poor air movement over the left lung. A lateral decubitus x-ray of the chest shows a pleural effusion height of 2 cm. Thoracentesis is performed and pleural fluid analysis reveals a protein concentration of 4.0 g/dL and LDH of 80 U/L. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's effusion?

A. Impaired lymphatic flow
B. Increased pulmonary capillary permeability
C. Decreased intrapleural pressure
D. Decreased plasma oncotic pressure

Answer: B. Increased pulmonary capillary permeability

Rationale: The patient's pleural effusion is likely caused by increased pulmonary capillary permeability, allowing fluid to seep into the pleural space. This is a common complication in patients with COPD, particularly those with severe exacerbations. The other options are less likely to be the underlying cause of the patient's effusion. Impaired lymphatic flow would not cause pleural effusion in this context, as lymphatic vessels are not involved in the removal of fluid from the pleural space. Decreased intrapleural pressure would not lead to pleural effusion, as the pressure within the pleural space is typically positive. Decreased plasma oncotic pressure, while a potential contributor to pleural effusion in some cases, is not a likely cause in this patient given the patient's history of COPD and recent exacerbation."
744,"Question: The immune system of a mouse model infected with Escherichia coli is being studied by an investigator. Which of the following spleen anatomical regions is crucial for the initial maturation of B cells that will ultimately target E. coli?

Options:
A. Red pulp - The red pulp is the peripheral part of the spleen where old and damaged red blood cells are stored and recycled.
B. Marginal zone - The marginal zone is the outer layer of the spleen where immune cells, including B cells, are located and patrol for foreign substances.
C. Germinal center - The germinal center is a specialized area within the spleen where B cells undergo clonal expansion and affinity maturation in response to antigen stimulation. This is the anatomical site where B cells mature and become specialized in targeting E. coli.
D. Sinusoids - The sinusoids are specialized blood vessels within the spleen that allow for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the blood and the splenic tissue. While the sinusoids are important for the overall functioning of the spleen, they are not directly involved in the initial maturation of B cells targeting E. coli.

Answer: C. Germinal center."
745,"Question:

How do lifestyle factors influence medical students' specialty choices? Examine the connection between lifestyle factors and the difficulty of matching into various specialties using a scatter plot.

Options:

A. The harder the specialty is to match into, the higher the weekly work hours.
B. Weekly work hours have a stronger correlation with matching difficulty than median income.
C. Median income has a stronger correlation with matching difficulty than weekly work hours.
D. The higher the median income of a specialty, the shorter the weekly work hours.

Answer: C. Median income has a stronger correlation with matching difficulty than weekly work hours.

Explanation:

The scatter plot in Image A shows a positive correlation between median income and weekly work hours for both specialties. This means that as the median income of a specialty increases, the weekly work hours also tend to increase. Conversely, there is a negative correlation between weekly work hours and the difficulty of matching into a specialty. This means that as weekly work hours increase, the difficulty of matching into a specialty also increases. Therefore, option C is the best description of the results."
746,"Question: A group of investigators is examining the effect of the drug orlistat as an adjunct therapy to lifestyle modification on weight loss in obese volunteers. 800 obese participants were randomized to receive orlistat in addition to counseling on lifestyle modification, and 800 obese participants were randomized to receive counseling on lifestyle modification alone. At the conclusion of the study, the investigators found that patients who underwent combined therapy lost a mean of 8.2 kg (18.1 lb), whereas patients counseled on lifestyle modification alone lost a mean of 4.3 kg (9.5 lb) (p < 0.001). The investigators also observed that of the 120 participants who did not complete the study, 97 participants were in the lifestyle modification group and 23 participants were in the combination group. Based on this information, the investigators should be most concerned about which of the following?

A. Error in randomization: It is unlikely that there was an error in randomization, as the investigators did not provide any information to suggest that there was a systematic difference in the assignment of participants to the two groups.

B. Attrition bias: The investigators observed that 97 participants in the lifestyle modification group and 23 participants in the combination group did not complete the study. This suggests that there may be a bias in the sample, as participants in the lifestyle modification group were more likely to drop out of the study.

C. Nonresponse bias: The investigators did not provide any information to suggest that there were any differences in the response rates between the two groups.

D. Confounding bias: The investigators did not provide any information to suggest that there were any confounding variables that could have affected the outcome of the study.

Answer: B. Attrition bias. The difference in completion rates between the two groups suggests that there may be a bias in the sample, as participants in the lifestyle modification group were more likely to drop out of the study. This could have affected the results of the study and led to an overestimation of the effect of the combined therapy."
747,"Question: A 71-year-old male presents to the emergency department after experiencing a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. His son reports that he has been experiencing increasing confusion and weakness over the past several weeks, and his electrolyte panel reveals a sodium level of 120 mEq/L and a serum osmolality of 248 mOsm/kg, with a high urine osmolality. His temperature is 37° C (98.6° F), his respirations are 15/min, his pulse is 67/min, and his blood pressure is 122/88 mm Hg. On examination, he is disoriented, his pupils are round and reactive to light and accommodation, and his mucous membranes are moist. His heart has a regular rhythm without murmurs, his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, his abdomen is soft, and his extremities have no edema but his muscular strength is 3/5 bilaterally. There is hyporeflexia of all four extremities. What is the most likely cause of his symptoms?

A. Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) - This condition is characterized by excessive secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to hyponatremia and hyperosmolality. The patient's symptoms, including seizure, confusion, weakness, and hyporeflexia, are consistent with SIADH.

B. Sheehan's syndrome - This is a rare condition where there is a deficiency of pituitary hormones, including ADH, leading to hyponatremia and hyperosmolality. However, the patient's history of increasing confusion and weakness over several weeks suggests that SIADH is more likely.

C. Lithium use - Lithium can cause hyponatremia and hyperosmolality, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with SIADH.

D. Diabetic ketoacidosis - This condition is characterized by high blood sugar levels and can cause confusion, weakness, and seizures. However, the patient's blood sugar levels are not elevated, and his symptoms are more consistent with SIADH.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH)."
748,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 63-year-old man presents to his physician with a 2-month history of progressive fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations that worsen with physical activity and improve with rest. He has also experienced intermittent constipation, low-grade fever, and generalized myalgia for the past 3 months. He has lost 10.4 kg (23 lbs) in weight over the past 4 months despite unchanged appetite. On examination, his conjunctivae are pale. His laboratory results reveal anemia (hemoglobin concentration: 9.1 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume: 70 μm3, serum ferritin: 12 ng/mL), occult blood in his stool, and a positive colonoscopy showing a 1.7-cm exophytic ulcer with irregular, bleeding edges in the ascending colon. Which of the following biopsy findings is most likely to have contributed to the patient's condition?

Options:
A. A submucosal lipomatous polyp
B. A villous adenomatous polyp
C. A serrated hyperplastic polyp
D. A tubular adenomatous polyp

Answer: B. A villous adenomatous polyp"
749,"Question: A 52-year-old woman presents to the physician with a 1-month history of mild fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath. She has no prior medical history and takes no medications. Cardiopulmonary examination reveals a mid-diastolic plopping sound heard best at the apex and bilateral rales at the base of the lungs. Echocardiography shows a pedunculated, heterogeneous mass in the left atrium. A biopsy of the mass reveals clusters of mesenchymal cells surrounded by gelatinous material. Which of the following is most likely to occur in this patient's further evaluation?

A. Elevated IL-6 serum levels
B. Enlarged lymph nodes in the armpits (axillary lymphadenopathy)
C. A malignant pleural effusion
D. Ash-leaf skin lesions

Answer: A. Increased IL-6 serum concentration.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the presence of a mass in the left atrium and the presence of rales at the base of the lungs, are consistent with a diagnosis of mesothelioma. Elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the blood are often seen in patients with mesothelioma, as it is a cytokine that is involved in the inflammatory response to the tumor. Therefore, it is likely that further evaluation will reveal increased IL-6 serum levels in this patient."

She reports that the child had a recent illness with cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea, and the lump developed during this time. Although the child's cough and congestion subsided, the neck lump persists. There is no significant medical history, and the child was born at 39 weeks gestation and is in the 55th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination reveals a small, soft, rounded mass at the midline of the neck inferior to the hyoid bone. The mass is warm and tender to palpation and moves superiorly when the patient drinks water. Histopathology of this lesion would most likely show:

A. Follicular cells surrounding colloid and admixed with a neutrophilic infiltrate.

This answer choice is correct because the description of the lesion suggests a benign tumor, specifically a thyroid nodule. The presence of follicular cells surrounding colloid and an admixed neutrophilic infiltrate are consistent with a follicular thyroid nodule, which is the most common type of benign thyroid nodule."
751,"Question: A 59-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a complaint of palpitations for the last 30 minutes. He denies chest pain, breathlessness, and loss of consciousness. The medical history is negative for hypertension or ischemic heart disease. On physical examination, the temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), the pulse rate is 146/min and irregular, the blood pressure is 118/80 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 15/min. A 12-lead electrocardiogram reveals an absence of normal P waves and the presence of saw tooth-appearing waves. The physician treats him with a single intravenous infusion of ibutilide under continuous electrographic monitoring, which successfully converts the abnormal rhythm to sinus rhythm. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the therapeutic action of this drug in this patient?

A. Prolongation of action potential duration by blocking the rapid outward sodium current
B. Prolongation of cardiac depolarization by blocking the potassium channels and activating the slow inward sodium current
C. Slowing the rapid upstroke during phase 0 by blocking the calcium channels
D. Suppression of phase 4 upstroke in the myocardial fibers by slowly dissociating from sodium channels

Answer: B. Prolongation of cardiac depolarization by blocking the potassium channels and activating the slow inward sodium current

Explanation: Ibutilide works by blocking the potassium channels in the heart, which prolongs the duration of cardiac depolarization. This allows for a longer window of time for the slow inward sodium current to activate, leading to a more stable and regular heartbeat. The other options are not correct mechanisms of ibutilide's therapeutic action in this patient. Prolongation of action potential duration by blocking the rapid outward sodium current would not have a significant impact on the abnormal rhythm in this patient, as the rhythm is already irregular. Slowing the rapid upstroke during phase 0 by blocking the calcium channels would also not explain the therapeutic action of ibutilide in this patient, as the abnormal rhythm is not caused by an excessive rapid upstroke. Suppression of phase 4 upstroke in the myocardial fibers by slowly dissociating from sodium channels is also not a relevant mechanism, as ibutilide does not directly affect the myocardial fibers."

Question: A 44-year-old woman with high blood pressure and diabetes visits your outpatient clinic, expressing her desire to conceive. Her current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and sitagliptin. Her blood pressure is 136/92 mmHg and heart rate is 79 bpm. Following a physical examination, what should you do regarding her medication for high blood pressure?

Options:
A. Carry on with the current regimen
B. Discontinue lisinopril and introduce labetalol
C. Proceed with the current regimen and add a beta-blocker for enhanced control
D. Discontinue lisinopril and switch to candesartan

Answer: B. Discontinue lisinopril and introduce labetalol.

Explanation: As the patient is trying to conceive, it is crucial to optimize her blood pressure control to minimize the risks of pregnancy complications. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, can cross the placenta and may potentially cause fetal growth restriction or other adverse outcomes. Labetalol, a beta-blocker, is a safer alternative for blood pressure control during pregnancy."
754,"Question: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician due to coughing and difficulty breathing that started shortly after he was found in the living room playing with his older brother's toys. He appears anxious. Respirations are 33/min and pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Physical examination reveals nasal flaring and intercostal retractions. Auscultation of the lungs shows a high-pitched inspiratory wheeze and absent breath sounds on the right side. There is no improvement in his oxygen saturation after applying a non-rebreather mask with 100% FiO2. Which of the following terms best describes the most likely underlying mechanism of the right lung's impaired ventilation?

A. Alveolar dead space
B. Diffusion limitation
C. Alveolar hypoventilation
D. Right-to-left shunt

Answer: D. Right-to-left shunt

Explanation: Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely underlying mechanism of the right lung's impaired ventilation is a right-to-left shunt. This is because the patient has a high-pitched inspiratory wheeze and absent breath sounds on the right side of the chest, which suggests that there is a flow of air from the right side to the left side of the lungs. This can occur due to various reasons such as a congenital or acquired cardiac or pulmonary condition, or a foreign body aspiration. The other options, alveolar dead space, diffusion limitation, and alveolar hypoventilation, are less likely mechanisms for the patient's symptoms based on the information provided."
755,"Question: A 42-year-old woman presents with stiffness and pain in multiple joints, including the fingers of both hands, which have become increasingly difficult to move over the past 8 months. She also experiences nail abnormalities, such as easy breakage and spotty appearance, as well as chronic back pain. She has a history of a urinary tract infection treated with antibiotics a year ago, and is sexually active with two male partners, using condoms inconsistently. Her vital signs are within normal limits. A photograph of her right hand shows multiple, well-demarcated red plaques with silvery-white scales on the shins and back. Serum studies reveal a negative rheumatoid factor and ANA. Based on this information, the most likely diagnosis is:

A. Secondary syphilis
B. Ankylosing spondylitis
C. Systemic lupus erythematosus
D. Psoriatic arthritis

Answer: D. Psoriatic arthritis

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms of joint stiffness and pain, nail abnormalities, and skin lesions are all consistent with psoriatic arthritis. The negative rheumatoid factor and ANA serum studies rule out other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient's history of a urinary tract infection and inconsistent condom use may suggest a possible association with psoriasis, which can also cause arthritis. The photograph of the patient's right hand shows well-demarcated red plaques with silvery-white scales, which are characteristic of psoriatic arthritis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is psoriatic arthritis."

She drinks 8 beers daily. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Blood and sputum cultures grow gram-negative, catalase-positive, capsulated bacilli. Which of the following components of the causal organism is the most likely cause of this patient's hypotension?

Options:
A. Lecithinase - Lecithinase is an enzyme that is not typically associated with the causative organism in this scenario.
B. Lipooligosaccharide - Lipoooligosaccharide is a component of the lipopolysaccharide layer of the causative organism, but it is not the most likely cause of hypotension in this case.
C. Teichoic acid - Teichoic acid is a component of the cell wall of the causative organism, but it is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of hypotension.
D. Lipid A - Lipid A is a major component of the outer membrane of the causative organism and is directly involved in the pathogenesis of hypotension by interfering with the host's endothelial cells and causing vascular permeability and capillary leak syndrome.

759,"Question: A 42-year-old man presents with an oral cavity lesion, toothache, and weight loss. He is known to have been HIV-positive for 6 years, but he does not follow a prescribed antiretroviral regimen because of personal beliefs. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 89/min, respiratory rate 17/min, and temperature 37.1°C (100.8°F). The physical examination revealed an ulcerative lesion located on the lower lip. The lesion was friable, as evidenced by contact bleeding, and tender on palpation. A CT scan showed the lesion to be a solid mass (7 x 6 x 7 cm3) invading the mandible and spreading to the soft tissues of the oral cavity floor. A biopsy was obtained to determine the tumor type, which showed a monotonous diffuse lymphoid proliferation of large cells with plasmablastic differentiation, and oval-to-round vesicular nuclei with fine chromatin. The cells are immunopositive for VS38c. DNA of which of the following viruses is most likely to be identified in the tumor cells?

A. EBV (Answer)

The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and biopsy results are consistent with a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer that is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The presence of plasmablastic differentiation in the tumor cells and the immunopositivity for VS38c are also consistent with an EBV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma. Therefore, the most likely virus to be identified in the tumor cells is EBV."
760,"Question:

A 13-year-old girl presents to an orthopedic surgeon for evaluation of a spinal curvature detected during a school screening. She has been healthy and does not take any medications. On examination, significant asymmetry of her back is observed, and she is sent for a spine radiograph. The radiograph reveals a unilateral rib attached to the left transverse process of the C7 vertebra. Which of the following genes is most likely responsible for this finding?

Options:

A. Homeobox
B. PAX
C. Sonic hedgehog
D. WNT7

Answer: A. Homeobox.

Explanation:
The presence of a unilateral rib attached to the left transverse process of the C7 vertebra in a 13-year-old girl is a rare congenital anomaly known as spinal rib anomaly or spinal rib fusion. This condition is caused by mutations in genes that regulate embryonic development and cell signaling pathways, particularly the homeobox genes. Homeobox genes are a group of transcription factors that play a crucial role in the regulation of embryonic development, cell differentiation, and tissue patterning.

The most likely gene responsible for this finding is the homeobox gene, which is a family of transcription factors that play a crucial role in the regulation of embryonic development and cell differentiation. Mutations in the homeobox genes can lead to various congenital anomalies, including spinal rib anomalies. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
761,"Question: A 31-year-old woman presents with headaches and nausea for 2 weeks, along with brief episodes of visual loss in both eyes, especially upon standing or bending. She is 165 cm tall and weighs 98 kg, with a BMI of 36 kg/m2. Vital signs are normal, and examination reveals mild peripheral vision loss and bilateral optic disc swelling. An MRI of the brain shows no abnormalities, and a lumbar puncture reveals a raised opening pressure and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Acetazolamide therapy: Given the patient's symptoms and the abnormal CSF analysis, acetazolamide therapy may help to reduce the pressure inside the skull and alleviate the symptoms. Acetazolamide is a diuretic that can help to reduce the amount of fluid in the CSF, which may help to decrease the pressure inside the skull and improve visual acuity.

B. Optic nerve sheath fenestration: This surgical procedure involves creating a small hole in the optic nerve sheath to allow CSF to flow through and reduce pressure inside the skull. However, this procedure is typically reserved for patients with more severe optic nerve compression, and may not be necessary in this case.

C. Ventricular shunting: This involves inserting a shunt to drain excess CSF from the brain to another part of the body, such as the abdomen. While this may be necessary in some cases of hydrocephalus, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management given the findings so far.

D. Furosemide therapy: Furosemide is a diuretic that can help to reduce the amount of fluid in the body, including the CSF. However, it may not be the most effective treatment for this patient's condition, as it may not reduce the pressure inside the skull or improve visual acuity.

Answer: A. Acetazolamide therapy"

She notes difficulty lifting both arms but they function normally otherwise. On examination, she has 2/5 muscle strength on shoulder shrug and arm abduction bilaterally, but all other neurological exam findings are normal. Additionally, the patient reports a rash around her eyes and on her lower face, extending down to her neck and chest, which started around the same time as the weakness began. Which of the following conditions is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Polymyalgia rheumatica - This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and stiffness in the shoulders and hips, but not in the arms.
B. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) - This is an autoimmune disorder that causes muscle weakness and fatigue, particularly in the muscles controlling eye movement, swallowing, and breathing.
C. Dermatomyositis - This is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes a skin rash, muscle weakness, and joint pain. The rash typically appears as a red, scaly patch on the skin, and can also involve the eyes and mouth.
D. Fibromyalgia - This is a chronic condition characterized by widespread muscle pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances, but not typically associated with skin rashes.

764,"Question: A 47-year-old man presents to the physician with persistent abdominal pain and foul-smelling, watery diarrhea for several days. He has no history of nausea, vomiting, or blood in the stool. He has a history of alcohol use disorder and recently completed a 7-day course of clindamycin for pneumonia. He has not traveled outside of the United States. Which of the following toxins is most likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. Shiga toxin: This toxin is produced by certain strains of E. coli and can cause symptoms similar to those described in the patient, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. However, Shiga toxin is not typically associated with alcohol use disorder or recent antibiotic use.

B. Cholera toxin: Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae and can cause severe diarrhea and dehydration. However, the patient does not have a history of travel to areas where cholera is common, and the symptoms described are not typical of cholera.

C. Cereulide toxin: Cereulide is a toxin produced by the bacterium Corynebacterium species and can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and abdominal pain. However, cereulide toxin is not typically associated with alcohol use disorder or recent antibiotic use.

D. Clostridioides difficile cytotoxin: Clostridioides difficile is a common cause of diarrhea and abdominal pain, particularly in individuals with a history of antibiotic use. The patient's recent use of clindamycin increases the likelihood that C. difficile may be involved in their symptoms.

Answer: D. Clostridioides difficile cytotoxin."
765,"Question: A 72-year-old man with coronary artery disease presents to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath for the past 3 hours. Troponin levels are elevated and an ECG shows ST-elevations in the precordial leads. Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention is performed, and a stent is placed in the left anterior descending artery. Two days later, he complains of worsening shortness of breath. Pulse oximetry on 3L of nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. An x-ray of the chest shows distended pulmonary veins, small horizontal lines at the lung bases, and blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally. Which of the following findings would be most likely on a ventilation-perfusion scan of this patient?

A. Increased apical ventilation with normal perfusion bilaterally
B. Matched ventilation and perfusion bilaterally
C. Normal perfusion with bilateral ventilation defects
D. Normal perfusion with decreased ventilation at the right base

Answer: C. Normal perfusion with bilateral ventilation defects

Rationale: The patient's chest x-ray shows bilateral blunting of the costophrenic angles, which is consistent with bilateral ventilation defects. A ventilation-perfusion scan would likely show normal perfusion bilaterally, with increased ventilation in the areas of the lungs where there are ventilation defects. Therefore, option C is the most likely finding on a ventilation-perfusion scan of this patient."
766,"Question: A 57-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloating that have increased in severity over the past several months. She reports that she occasionally vomits after eating, with undigested food particles in the emesis. Additionally, the patient states that she often feels satiated after only a few bites of food at meals. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. Initial laboratory values are notable only for a hemoglobin A1c of 14%. Which of the following is the best initial treatment for this patient?

Options:

A. Dietary modification: This is the best initial treatment for the patient's symptoms. The patient's history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus may contribute to her symptoms, and a dietary intervention may help to manage these conditions. A dietitian can help the patient to identify and avoid trigger foods, and to develop a meal plan that is tailored to her individual needs.

B. Erythromycin: While antibiotics may be considered for the patient's symptoms, erythromycin is not the best option. Erythromycin is an antibiotic that is primarily used to treat bacterial infections, and it may not be effective in managing the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms.

C. Myotomy: This is not a recommended treatment for the patient's symptoms. Myotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting or dividing a muscle, and it is typically used to treat conditions such as achalasia or gastroparesis. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and a less invasive treatment such as dietary modification or proton pump inhibitors may be more appropriate.

D. Surgical resection: This is not a recommended treatment for the patient's symptoms. While surgical intervention may be necessary in some cases of GERD, such as those with severe symptoms or complications, surgical resection is not typically recommended as a first line treatment.

Answer: A. Dietary modification"
767,"Question: A 63-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe pain in his left groin, which began after a walk. He describes the pain as 8/10 in intensity and has vomited once on the way to the hospital. He has had a swelling in his left groin for the past 2 months. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension, and is currently taking amlodipine, albuterol inhaler, and a salmeterol-fluticasone inhaler. On examination, a tender bulge is noted on the left side above the inguinal ligament that extends into the left scrotum, which does not reduce with lying down or external pressure. Coughing does not exacerbate the swelling. There is no erythema or abdominal tenderness, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Scattered rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Antibiotic therapy
B. Open surgical repair
C. Surgical exploration of the testicle
D. Laparoscopic surgical repair

Answer: B. Open surgical repair

Rationale: The patient's sudden onset of severe pain in the left groin, along with the tender bulge and swelling, suggest a possible diagnosis of testicular torsion. Testicular torsion is a medical emergency that requires prompt surgical intervention to prevent permanent damage to the testicle. Open surgical repair is the most appropriate next step in management, as it allows for direct visualization and repair of the affected testicular tissue. Antibiotic therapy may be considered as a secondary measure to cover any potential bacterial infection, but it is not the primary intervention for testicular torsion. Surgical exploration of the testicle may be considered if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen after initial repair, or if there are any concerns about the patency of the testicular vessels. Laparoscopic surgical repair is not typically used for testicular torsion due to the complexity of the procedure and the risk of complications."
768,"Question: A 34-year-old patient with a history of anxiety, chronic constipation, chronic headaches, and chronic hypertension presents to the emergency room with severe right flank pain radiating to his scrotum. A urinalysis with stone analysis is performed and the results are shown in figure A. Prior to discharge, it is noted that the patient's BP is still 170/110 mmHg. Furthermore, his calcium and PTH levels were both found to be increased. Which of the following representative histology slides of thyroid tissue represents a potential complication of the patient's condition?

Options:

A. Medullary thyroid cancer: This type of thyroid cancer originates in the medulla, or lower part, of the thyroid gland. It is characterized by the presence of calcitonin-producing cells, which can cause hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, as seen in the patient's elevated calcium levels.

B. Papillary thyroid cancer: This type of thyroid cancer originates in the follicular cells of the thyroid gland and is characterized by a papillary, or mushroom-like, growth pattern. While papillary thyroid cancer is not typically associated with hypercalcemia, it can cause symptoms such as hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing due to compression of the surrounding structures.

C. Lymphoma: This type of cancer originates in the immune system and can occur in various parts of the body, including the thyroid gland. Lymphoma in the thyroid gland can cause symptoms such as pain in the neck, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing.

D. Follicular thyroid cancer: This type of thyroid cancer originates in the follicular cells of the thyroid gland and is characterized by a follicular, or grape-like, growth pattern. While follicular thyroid cancer is not typically associated with hypercalcemia, it can cause symptoms such as hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing due to compression of the surrounding structures.

Answer: A. Medullary thyroid cancer."
769,"Question: A 23-year-old man is rushed to the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident where he was pinned between two cars for several hours. He has a history of asthma and intermittently uses an albuterol inhaler. The patient admits to having a few beers at a party prior to the accident. Upon presentation, the patient's vitals are stable, and he is immediately taken to the operating room for surgical intervention. The surgeon determines that the patient's right leg has a Gustilo IIIC injury in the mid-shaft of the tibia with a severely comminuted fracture, while the left leg sustained a similar injury with damage to the peroneal nerve. The anesthesiologist begins inducing anesthesia. Which of the following anesthetic agents would be contraindicated in this patient?

A. Succinylcholine: Succinylcholine is a depolarizing muscle relaxant that can cause a significant increase in intracellular calcium, which can exacerbate existing respiratory muscle weakness in patients with asthma. Given the patient's history of asthma, succinylcholine is contraindicated in this scenario.

B. Halothane: Halothane is a volatile anesthetic that can cause respiratory depression in patients with pre-existing respiratory disease, including asthma. Although the patient's vitals are stable in the ambulance, the risk of respiratory depression cannot be ruled out during surgery, making halothane a potential contraindication.

C. Neostigmine: Neostigmine is a cholinergic agent that can cause bronchospasm in patients with asthma. Given the patient's history of asthma, neostigmine is contraindicated in this scenario.

D. Etomidate: Etomidate is an intravenous anesthetic agent that can cause respiratory depression, which may be problematic in a patient with a history of asthma. However, etomidate has a lower risk of respiratory depression compared to halothane, making it a potentially safer option.

Answer: D. Succinylcholine"

771,"Question: A 68-year-old man presents with recurrent episodes of nausea and abdominal discomfort lasting 4 months, exacerbated by meals and stair climbing. He has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral arterial disease, as well as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. His physical examination is unremarkable, with absent foot pulses bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) - This test is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosis as it is not specifically designed to evaluate the symptoms of abdominal discomfort and nausea in this patient.

B. Hydrogen breath test (HBT) - This test may be useful in evaluating for small intestine disorders, such as lactose intolerance or small intestine bacterial overgrowth, but it is not the most appropriate test for this patient's symptoms.

C. Cardiac stress test (CST) - This test is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis as the patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort and nausea may be related to coronary artery disease, which is a common complication in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. A CST can help evaluate the patient's cardiovascular health and identify any potential coronary artery disease.

D. Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant (RUQ) - This test may be useful in evaluating for liver or gallbladder disorders, but it is not the most appropriate test for this patient's symptoms.

Answer: C. Cardiac stress test."
772,"Question: A 52-year-old woman visits her primary care physician for her annual checkup. She has been feeling hopeless and unmotivated since losing her job six months ago, finding it difficult to concentrate and enjoying activities she once loved, such as puzzles and gardening. She sleeps over 10 hours a day due to lack of energy. Despite these symptoms, she denies any suicidal thoughts. Which of the following neurotransmitter profiles is most likely to be present in this patient?

Options:
A. Decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
B. Decreased serotonin and norepinephrine
C. Increased dopamine
D. Increased norepinephrine

Answer: B. Decreased serotonin and norepinephrine.

The patient's symptoms of hopelessness, lack of motivation, and difficulty concentrating are consistent with a decreased serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmitter profile. These neurotransmitters play a crucial role in mood regulation, motivation, and cognitive function, and their deficiency can lead to depressive symptoms. Additionally, the patient's increased sleepiness and lack of energy are also consistent with a decreased serotonin and norepinephrine profile. While dopamine and norepinephrine can also be involved in depressive symptoms, the patient's lack of suicidal ideation suggests that the depression is not severe enough to warrant an increased dopamine profile."
773,"Question: The patient, a 34-year-old gravida 2 para 1 woman at 16 weeks gestation, presents for prenatal care. Her prenatal course has been uncomplicated. She takes no medications besides her prenatal vitamin which she takes every day, and she has been compliant with routine prenatal care. She has a 7-year-old daughter who is healthy. The results of her recent quadruple screen are listed below:

AFP: Low
hCG: Low
Estriol: Low
Inhibin-A: Normal

What is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis?

A. Amniocentesis: This is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis. Amniocentesis is a diagnostic test that involves withdrawing a small sample of amniotic fluid from the uterus to check for genetic abnormalities. In this case, the low levels of AFP and hCG, along with the normal levels of Inhibin-A, suggest that the patient may have a chromosomal abnormality in the fetus. Amniocentesis can confirm this diagnosis by detecting any abnormalities in the DNA of the fetus.

B. Chorionic villus sampling: This option is incorrect because chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a diagnostic test that involves removing a small sample of tissue from the placenta to check for genetic abnormalities. While CVS can be used to diagnose certain genetic conditions, it is not as sensitive as amniocentesis for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.

C. Return to clinic in 4 weeks: This option is incorrect because the patient has already had a quadruple screening test, which is a routine test that is typically performed between 15 and 20 weeks of gestation. The results of this test can help identify potential risks of chromosomal abnormalities, but it is not a diagnostic test. Therefore, returning to the clinic in 4 weeks is not a viable option for confirming the diagnosis.

D. Ultrasound for nuchal translucency: This option is incorrect because nuchal translucency (NT) is a measure of the thickness of the skin at the back of the fetus's neck. While an ultrasound can be used to measure NT, it is not a diagnostic test for chromosomal abnormalities.

Answer: A. Amniocentesis"
774,"Question: A 65-year-old man has decreased urinary output two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catheterization for unstable angina pectoris. What is the most likely cause of his presentation?

Options:
A. Allergic interstitial nephritis
B. Cholesterol embolization
C. Contrast-induced nephropathy
D. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis

Answer: B. Cholesterol embolization

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of decreased urinary output, mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet, and ischemic changes on the right big toe, along with his elevated serum creatinine concentration and abnormal kidney biopsy results, are consistent with cholesterol embolization. Cholesterol embolization occurs when cholesterol crystals from the atherosclerotic plaque in the arteries break off and travel to the kidneys, causing inflammation and damage. The patient's history of cardiac catheterization and the presence of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries increase the likelihood of cholesterol embolization as the cause of the patient's presentation. Allergic interstitial nephritis, contrast-induced nephropathy, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis are less likely causes based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results."
775,"Question: A 75-year-old female presents to the physician's office with complaints of right lower quadrant pain that has been persistent for the last 6 months and has gradually worsened. An ultrasound reveals a large ovarian mass, and abdominal and pelvic CT scans do not show any metastases. Her serum levels of CA-125 are elevated, and the biopsy confirms the primary neoplasm to be ovarian in origin. The cancer is classified as invasive carcinoma without metastasis. Which of the following cellular changes is consistent with this diagnosis?

Options:
A. Intact basement membrane - This option is incorrect because the loss of E-cadherin is a common feature of ovarian cancer. E-cadherin is a protein that helps maintain the adhesion of cells to each other, and its loss can lead to increased cellular mobility and invasiveness.
B. Loss of E-cadherin - This option is the correct answer. The loss of E-cadherin is a hallmark of ovarian cancer and is a key feature that distinguishes it from other types of cancer. The loss of E-cadherin can lead to increased cellular mobility and invasiveness, which can contribute to the progression of the cancer.
C. Seeding via capillaries - This option is incorrect because ovarian cancer typically does not involve the seeding of cells through capillaries. While some ovarian cancers may have a vascular component, the primary mechanism of growth and spread is through the invasion of surrounding tissues.
D. Increased proliferation of cells with preservation of size and shape - This option is also incorrect because ovarian cancer typically exhibits increased cellular proliferation without any significant changes in cell size or shape. The uncontrolled growth and division of cancer cells can lead to the formation of tumors, which can invade and destroy surrounding tissues.

Answer: B. Loss of E-cadherin"
776,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 5-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency department due to a progressive rash that started 2 days ago. The rash started on his face and spread to his trunk and extremities. He has also had a runny nose, cough, and red, crusty eyes over the past week. His family recently immigrated from Turkey, and his father and older brother have Behcet disease. His immunization records are unavailable. During the examination, he appears irritable and cries, and his temperature is 40.0°C (104°F). Examination reveals general lymphadenopathy, dry mucous membranes, and decreased skin turgor. A blanching, partially confluent erythematous maculopapular exanthema is also present on his skin. Two 5-mm aphthous ulcers are found on the base of his tongue. His hemoglobin level is 11.5 g/dL, his leukocyte count is 6,000/mm3, and his platelet count is 215,000/mm3. Serology confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Oral acyclovir
B. Vitamin A supplementation
C. Reassurance and follow-up in 3 days
D. Oral penicillin V

Answer: B. Vitamin A supplementation"
777,"Question: A 2-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department in the middle of the night due to difficulty breathing. Her parents report that her breathing noises have worsened throughout the day and are primarily heard during inhalation. They also mention that changing her position does not affect her breathing. For the past three days, she has had a runny nose and harsh cough, without any hemoptysis. The parents are concerned that she may have accidentally swallowed something while playing with her toys, as she tends to put small objects in her mouth. Her immunizations are up-to-date. On examination, she appears lethargic, and high-pitched wheezing is heard at rest during inhalation. Her skin tone is normal, and her temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse is 142/min, respirations are 33/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. An x-ray of the neck and upper chest is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Noninvasive ventilation
B. Nebulized epinephrine
C. Albuterol and ipratropium inhaler
D. Reassurance

Answer: B. Nebulized epinephrine

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening breathing noises, primarily heard during inhalation, and the presence of a runny nose and harsh cough for the past three days, suggest an upper airway obstruction. The absence of hemoptysis suggests that the obstruction is not due to a lower airway problem. Nebulized epinephrine is the most appropriate next step in management, as it can help to open up the airways and improve breathing. Noninvasive ventilation may not be necessary at this stage, as the patient's respiratory distress is not severe enough to require it. Albuterol and ipratropium inhaler may be considered as a next step, but nebulized epinephrine is more immediate and effective in opening up the airways in cases of upper airway obstruction. Reassurance alone is not sufficient to manage the patient's symptoms."
778,"Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of pain and swelling of his right knee joint for 1 day. He has not had any trauma to the knee. He was born at term and has been healthy since. His maternal uncle has a history of a bleeding disorder. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F) and pulse is 97/min. The right knee is erythematous, swollen, and tender; range of motion is limited. No other joints are affected. An x-ray of the knee shows an effusion but no structural abnormalities of the joint. Arthrocentesis is done. The synovial fluid is bloody. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?

Options:

A. Decreased platelet count
B. Prolonged partial thromboplastin time
C. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate
D. Elevated antinuclear antibody levels

Answer: B. Prolonged partial thromboplastin time

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling in the right knee joint, along with the positive arthrocentesis result of bloody synovial fluid, suggest a diagnosis of hemophilic arthropathy. Hemophilic arthropathy is a condition where the body's inability to clot blood leads to recurrent joint bleeding and inflammation. The patient's family history of a bleeding disorder, specifically hemophilia, supports this diagnosis.

Prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is a common laboratory test used to diagnose and monitor bleeding disorders such as hemophilia. An elevated PTT result indicates a prolonged clotting time, which can be indicative of a bleeding disorder. In this case, the patient's PTT is likely to be prolonged, which supports the diagnosis of hemophilic arthropathy.

The other options are not as relevant to the patient's condition. A decreased platelet count is not typically associated with hemophilic arthropathy, as platelets are not involved in blood clotting. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and elevated antinuclear antibody levels are not specific to hemophilic arthropathy and can be elevated in a variety of conditions."
779,"Question: A 41-year-old woman presents to the physician with bleeding from the nipple of her right breast that has been persistent for 3 months, with no bleeding in the left breast. Her menstrual cycle occurs at regular 30-day intervals and lasts for 5 days with moderate flow. Her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. The patient's mother died of breast cancer at the age of 53. She does not smoke or drink alcohol and appears healthy. Her temperature is 37°C (98.7°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 118/70 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination reveals no abnormalities, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender. Breast examination shows bleeding on application of pressure to the right breast without a palpable mass, and the left breast shows no abnormalities. There is no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy detected during pelvic examination. Ultrasonography reveals a dilated duct with a well-defined solitary mass. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Invasive ductal carcinoma
B. Paget disease of the breast
C. Papillary carcinoma
D. Intraductal papilloma

Answer: D. Intraductal papilloma.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of bleeding from the nipple of the right breast for 3 months, without any other breast abnormalities, and the finding of a dilated duct with a well-defined solitary mass on ultrasonography are highly suggestive of an intraductal papilloma. Intraductal papillomas are benign tumors that arise within the breast ducts and can cause bleeding, particularly when the duct is dilated. The patient's family history of breast cancer in her mother at a young age also supports this diagnosis."
780,"Question: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme-containing molecule found in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils. Upon release, the enzyme catalyzes hypochlorous acid production during the phagocytic response. In the context of pneumonia, what is the end result and clinical significance of this reaction?

Options:
A. Green color of sputum
B. Cough
C. Rust-tinged sputum
D. Shortness of breath

Answer: A. Green color of sputum

Explanation: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme released by neutrophils during the phagocytic response to pneumonia. When hypochlorous acid is produced through the MPO-catalyzed reaction, it can oxidize the lung tissue, resulting in the characteristic green color of sputum. This green color is a sign of the inflammatory response and can indicate the effectiveness of the immune system in fighting off the infection. However, excessive production of hypochlorous acid can also damage lung tissue and contribute to the progression of pneumonia. Therefore, the green color of sputum is not only a clinical sign of inflammation but also a reflection of the balance between the host's immune response and the pathogen's virulence."
781,"Question: A 1-year-old boy is brought to his physician for a routine checkup by his mother. During the examination, the child is observed to be happy and playful, meeting normal cognitive development markers. However, the child's arms and legs are not meeting their developmental goals, while their head and torso are. The mother reveals that the boy's father has this condition. Which of the following genetic mutations is associated with this presentation?

Options:
A. Underactivation of FGFR3
B. GAA repeat
C. Deletion of DMD
D. Overactivation of FGFR3

Answer: D. Overactivation of FGFR3"
782,"Question: A 70-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of severe lower back pain for 3 weeks. The pain was initially exacerbated by activity but now presents also at rest. The patient has not had a headache or a cough. He reports no changes in bowel movements or urination. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His current medications include metformin and lisinopril. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 86/min, and blood pressure is 134/92 mm Hg. Examination shows tenderness over the spinous processes of the second and third lumbar vertebrae with significant paraspinal spasm. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:

Hemoglobin 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 10,800 /mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 75 mm/h
CRP 82 mg/L (N = 0–10 mg/L)
Serum
Ca2+ 9.6 mg/dL
Urea nitrogen 22 mg/dL
Glucose 216 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.1 mg/dL
Albumin 3.7 g/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 55 U/L
An x-ray of the lumbar spine shows bone destruction, sequestrum formation, and periosteal reactions along the second and third lumbar vertebrae. An MRI of the lumbar spine shows increased T2 signals within the second and third lumbar vertebrae without signs of epidural abscess. A blood culture is taken and he is started on appropriate analgesia. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?

A. CT-guided biopsy

CT-guided biopsy is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest the possibility of an infection, such as an abscess or osteomyelitis, which may require further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. CT-guided biopsy can help to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

B. Surgical debridement

Surgical debridement is not the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. While surgical debridement may be necessary in some cases of infection, it is not the first line of treatment for this patient's symptoms. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest the possibility of an infection, but further diagnostic evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

C. Prostate-specific antigen assay

A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay is not the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest the possibility of prostate infection or disease.

D. Isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol

Isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol are not the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. These medications are antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis, but they are not the first line of treatment for this patient's symptoms. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest the possibility of an infection, but further diagnostic evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment."
783,"Question: A 12-hour-old newborn is urgently transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit because he is found to be cyanotic and appears blue in all four extremities. He was born to a 42-year-old G1P1 mother who underwent no prenatal screening because she did not show up to her prenatal care visits. She has poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension. On physical exam, the infant is found to have slanted eyes, a flattened head, a large tongue, and a single palmar crease bilaterally. Furthermore, a single, loud S2 murmur is appreciated in this patient. Radiography shows a large oblong-shaped heart shadow. Based on this presentation, the neonatologist starts a medication that will temporarily ensure this patient's survival pending definitive fixation of the defect. The substance that was most likely administered in this case also has which of the following effects?

A. Decreased platelet aggregation
B. Increased bronchial tone
C. Vascular vasoconstriction
D. Vascular vasodilation

Answer: D. Vascular vasodilation

Explanation: The medication administered to the patient is most likely to be a vasoactive medication, such as dopamine or dobutamine, which are commonly used in neonatal care to increase blood flow and improve oxygenation in cyanotic newborns. These medications work by dilating blood vessels, which increases blood flow and oxygen delivery to the tissues. Therefore, the answer is (D) Vascular vasodilation."
784,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 65-year-old man visits his primary care physician with persistent bilateral calf pain that worsens after walking his dog a few blocks. He has a history of coronary artery disease, essential hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He smokes two packs of cigarettes daily and drinks two alcoholic beverages daily. His height is 183 cm (5 ft 11 in) and he weighs 113 kg (250 lb), with a BMI of 34.9 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 84/min, and blood pressure is 129/72 mm Hg. Cardiac examination reveals a gallop without murmurs, and the legs have shiny skin with reduced hair below the knee. Femoral and popliteal pulses are palpable bilaterally, but dorsal pedal pulses are absent on the right side. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) performed in the office shows a value of 0.5 in the right leg and 0.6 in the left leg. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?

A) Graded exercise therapy: This option is the most appropriate initial step in management as the patient has persistent bilateral calf pain that worsens with physical activity, indicating possible peripheral artery disease (PAD). Graded exercise therapy involves gradually increasing physical activity to improve cardiovascular fitness and reduce symptoms in patients with PAD.

B) Propranolol therapy: This option is not the most appropriate initial step in management as propranolol is a beta-blocker that is used to treat hypertension and angina, but not PAD.

C) Spinal cord stimulation: This option is not the most appropriate initial step in management as spinal cord stimulation is a treatment for chronic back pain and not PAD.

D) Vascular bypass surgery: This option is not the most appropriate initial step in management as vascular bypass surgery is a more complex and invasive procedure that is typically reserved for patients with severe PAD who have significant limb ischemia and are not candidates for less invasive treatments."
785,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question:
A 2-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency department after experiencing new-onset seizures. Following the seizure control with fosphenytoin loading, the medical team learns that the child has been displaying mild hypotonia and developmental delays since birth. The family also reveals a history of a genetic biochemical disorder on the maternal side, although they are unsure of the specific disease name. Physical examination and initial laboratory tests show no abnormalities, but further blood work reveals an accumulation of alanine and pyruvate. Based on these findings, which of the following enzyme deficiencies is most likely responsible for the child's clinical syndrome?

Options:
A. Alanine transaminase
B. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
C. Pyruvate dehydrogenase
D. Pyruvate kinase

Answer: C. Pyruvate dehydrogenase"
786,"Question: The 26-year-old man presents with episodic palpitations and a feeling that his heart ""skips a beat"" for the past 2 months. His father has a history of atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years and drinks 1-2 beers on weekends. His vital signs are within normal limits, and physical examination and cardiopulmonary examination reveal no abnormalities. Serum studies, including electrolytes and creatinine, are within normal limits, and an excerpt of 24-hour Holter monitoring is shown. Echocardiography is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Coronary angiography
B. Metoprolol therapy
C. Permanent pacemaker placement
D. Smoking cessation

Answer: D. Smoking cessation

Rationale: The patient's history of smoking for 5 years and daily consumption increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, including atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction. The patient's symptoms of palpitations and skipped heartbeats are consistent with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which is a common complication of smoking. Smoking cessation is a crucial step in managing the patient's condition and reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. While coronary angiography may be considered in the future to evaluate the patient's coronary arteries, it is not the most appropriate next step in management at this time. Metoprolol therapy is a beta-blocker that can help control symptoms of atrial fibrillation, but it may not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition. Permanent pacemaker placement may be considered in the future if the patient's symptoms persist, but it is not necessary at this time."

788,"Question: A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department for severe abdominal pain. His pain is located in the epigastric region of his abdomen, which he describes as sharp and persistent. His symptoms began approximately 2 days prior to presentation, and he has tried acetaminophen and ibuprofen, which did not improve his symptoms. He feels nauseated and has had 2 episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious emesis. He has a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he is on chlorthalidone and simvastatin. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the last 20 years and drinks 1 pint of vodka per day. On physical exam, there is tenderness to palpation of the upper abdomen, and the patient is noted to have tender hepatomegaly. Serum studies demonstrate:

Amylase: 350 U/L (25-125 U/L)
Lipase: 150 U/L (12-53 U/L)
AST: 305 U/L (8-20 U/L)
ALT: 152 U/L (8-20 U/L)

He is admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous fluids and morphine. Approximately 18 hours after admission the patient reports to feeling anxious, tremulous, and having trouble falling asleep. His blood pressure is 165/105 mmHg and pulse is 140/min. On exam, the patient appears restless and diaphoretic. Which of the following will most likely improve this patient's symptoms?

A. Chlordiazepoxide
B. Haloperidol
C. Lorazepam
D. Risperidone

Answer: C. Lorazepam.

Explanation: Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that is commonly used to treat anxiety and insomnia. The patient's symptoms of anxiety, tremulousness, and difficulty falling asleep are consistent with an anxiety disorder, and lorazepam is likely to help alleviate these symptoms. Chlordiazepoxide is another benzodiazepine that could also be considered, but it may have a longer onset of action compared to lorazepam. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic that is not typically used to treat anxiety disorders, and risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that may have more side effects compared to lorazepam."
789,"Question: As a goalkeeper for a renowned soccer team, I recently spoke with a health agency about my childhood experiences. I recall constantly clearing my throat in class, and my teachers would write notes to my mother suggesting a visit to an ENT doctor. I found myself restless, fidgety, and sometimes hyperactive in class, causing disruptions and social difficulties. I would blurt out answers at times and repeat them without control, resulting in awkward timeouts. Despite these challenges, I was always polite to my teachers, so I like to refer to it as a ""benign frustration."" My symptoms significantly improved with medication. Which FDA-approved drug is most likely to have treated my condition?

A. Clonazepam
B. Guanfacine
C. Haloperidol
D. Lithium

790,"Question: A 64-year-old man visits the emergency department complaining of fatigue and abdominal distension. He has a history of intravenous drug use. His vital signs are normal, except for a pulse of 75 beats per minute. During the physical examination, jaundice and a firm liver are noted. Abdominal ultrasonography reveals liver surface nodularity, moderate splenomegaly, and an enlarged portal vein. The complete blood count of the patient shows:

Hemoglobin: 14 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume: 90/μm3
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin: 30 pg/cell
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration: 34%
Leukocyte count: 7,000/mm3

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the low platelet count in this patient?

A. Bone marrow disorder
B. Platelet sequestration
C. Increased platelet clearance
D. Genetic disorder

Answer: B. Platelet sequestration"
791,"Question: A 42-year-old woman presents with a 2-month history of progressive muscular weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, getting up from chairs, and brushing her hair. Her vital signs are normal. Muscle strength is 2/5 with flexion of the hips and 3/5 with abduction of the shoulders, and she cannot stand up from her chair without support. Laboratory tests reveal elevations in leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and creatine kinase concentration. The histological evaluation of a biopsy specimen of the deltoid muscle is likely to show:

A. Muscle fiber necrosis with rare inflammatory cells
B. Sarcolemmal MHC-I overexpression with CD8+ lymphocytic infiltration
C. Relative atrophy of type II muscle fibers with hypertrophy of type I muscle fibers
D. Perimysial inflammation with perivascular CD4+ T lymphocytic infiltration

Answer: B. Sarcolemmal MHC-I overexpression with CD8+ lymphocytic infiltration.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of myositis, an inflammatory disorder that affects the muscles. The biopsy specimen is likely to show an excessive expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the sarcolemma of muscle fibers, along with an infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes. This is in line with the diagnosis of myositis, which is characterized by an immune-mediated attack on muscle tissue. The other options are less likely to be present in this specific case."
792,"Question: A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with 8 days of dyspnea and palpitations with mild exertion. The symptoms have worsened and now last up to 45 minutes, despite subsiding immediately after ceasing activity. The patient has no significant medical history, except for a previous episode of flu with fever and chills. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 47/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 150/70 mm Hg. A resting ECG is shown, and two-step serological testing confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Intravenous ceftriaxone therapy: Given the patient's recent history of flu and the worsening nature of her symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is myocarditis, an inflammatory condition that can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic that is effective against many common causes of myocarditis, including streptococci and staphylococci.

B. Oral amoxicillin therapy: Amoxicillin is an antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacterial infections, including those that can cause myocarditis. However, given the patient's recent history of flu and the worsening nature of her symptoms, the likelihood of a bacterial infection is lower, and ceftriaxone may be a more appropriate choice.

C. Oral doxycycline therapy: Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacterial infections, including those that can cause myocarditis. However, given the patient's recent history of flu and the worsening nature of her symptoms, the likelihood of a bacterial infection is lower, and ceftriaxone may be a more appropriate choice.

D. Permanent pacemaker implantation: While a pacemaker may be necessary in cases of complete heart block, the patient's ECG does not show any signs of complete heart block, and the diagnosis of myocarditis is more likely. Therefore, pacemaker implantation is not the most appropriate next step in management."
793,"Sure! Here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: After a year of trying to conceive, a young couple in their early twenties decided to try in vitro fertilization. During preliminary testing of fertility, it was found that the male partner had dysfunctional sperm. Past medical history revealed that he had frequent sinus and lung infections throughout his life. The physician noted an abnormal exam finding on palpation of the right fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. What is the most likely diagnosis responsible for this patient's infertility?

Options:
A. Kartagener syndrome: This rare genetic disorder is characterized by recurring sinus and lung infections, as well as abnormalities in the structure and function of the sperm. The patient's history of frequent sinus and lung infections, combined with the abnormal exam finding on palpation, suggest that Kartagener syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.
B. Williams syndrome: This rare genetic disorder is characterized by cardiovascular problems, endocrinopathies, and developmental delays. While Williams syndrome can cause infertility in some cases, it is less likely to be the cause of the patient's infertility based on the symptoms provided.
C. Adenosine deaminase deficiency: This rare genetic disorder is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase, which can lead to immunodeficiency and recurring infections. While adenosine deaminase deficiency can cause infertility in some cases, it is less likely to be the cause of the patient's infertility based on the symptoms provided.
D. Chédiak-Higashi syndrome: This rare genetic disorder is characterized by recurring infections, immunodeficiency, and abnormalities in the structure and function of the sperm. While Chédiak-Higashi syndrome can cause infertility in some cases, it is less likely to be the cause of the patient's infertility based on the symptoms provided.

Answer: D. Kartagener syndrome"
794,"Question: Health officials are considering a modification to the interpretation of the tuberculin skin test that would lower the cut-off for a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) from 10 mm to 5 mm for healthcare workers. Which of the following statements accurately describes this potential change?

A. This alteration will lower the test's positive predictive value.
B. This alteration will lower the test's negative predictive value.
C. This alteration will not affect the test's negative predictive value.
D. This alteration will increase the test's specificity.

Answer: A. This change will decrease the positive predictive value of the test.

Explanation: The tuberculin skin test's positive predictive value (PPV) represents the proportion of individuals with a positive test result who actually have tuberculosis. A lower cut-off for a positive PPD result will result in more individuals being classified as positive, which in turn will lower the test's PPV. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
795,"Question: A 10-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric clinic because of persistent sinus infections. For the past 5 years, he has had multiple sinus and upper respiratory infections. He has also had recurrent diarrhea throughout childhood. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the heart rate is 90/min, the respirations are 16/min, and the blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show abnormally low levels of one immunoglobulin isotype but normal levels of others. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Chediak-Higashi syndrome: This rare genetic disorder is characterized by recurrent infections, immunodeficiency, and other systemic problems. While it is possible that the boy's symptoms could be related to this condition, the low levels of only one immunoglobulin isotype suggest that another immunodeficiency disorder is more likely.

B. Common variable immunodeficiency: This is the most likely diagnosis based on the boy's symptoms and laboratory results. Common variable immunodeficiency is a primary immunodeficiency disorder that affects the immune system's ability to produce antibodies. It is characterized by recurrent infections, particularly of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and abnormal immunoglobulin levels.

C. Drug-induced IgA deficiency: While the boy's symptoms could be related to a drug-induced immunodeficiency, the low levels of only one immunoglobulin isotype suggest that another immunodeficiency disorder is more likely.

D. Selective IgA deficiency: This is the least likely diagnosis based on the boy's symptoms and laboratory results. Selective IgA deficiency is a rare immunodeficiency disorder that affects the immune system's ability to produce antibodies in the mucous membranes. While it can cause recurrent infections, particularly of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, the boy's symptoms are more consistent with a primary immunodeficiency disorder such as common variable immunodeficiency.

Answer: D. Selective IgA deficiency"
796,"Question: While attending a holiday party, a 35-year-old widow notices a male who physically resembles her deceased husband. She introduces herself and begins a conversation with the male while making sure not to mention the resemblance. After the conversation, she feels feelings of affection and warmth towards the male similar to how her husband made her feel. Which of the following best explains the widow's feelings towards the male?

Options:
A. Transference: The widow's feelings towards the male are a result of unconsciously transferring her feelings towards her deceased husband onto the male, as they share a physical resemblance.
B. Countertransference: The widow's feelings towards the male are a result of her unconscious reaction to the male's presence, which is influenced by her past experiences with her husband.
C. Projection: The widow's feelings towards the male are a result of her projecting her own feelings and desires onto the male, as a way of coping with her loss.
D. Identification: The widow's feelings towards the male are a result of identifying with the male's qualities and characteristics, as a way of finding comfort and familiarity in a new person.

Answer: A. Transference"
797,"Question: An 8-day-old male infant presents to the pediatrician with a high-grade fever and poor feeding pattern with regurgitation of milk after each feeding. On examination, the infant shows abnormal movements, hypertonia, and exaggerated DTRs. The mother explains that during her pregnancy, she has tried to eat only unprocessed foods and unpasteurized dairy so that her baby would not be exposed to any preservatives or unhealthy chemicals. Which of the following microorganisms is most likely to cause this illness in the infant?

Options:

A. Streptococcus pneumoniae - Gram-positive, facultative intracellular, motile bacilli
B. Staphylococcus aureus - Gram-positive, catalase-negative, beta-hemolytic, bacitracin-resistant cocci
C. Escherichia coli - Gram-negative, lactose-fermenting, facultative anaerobic bacilli
D. Klebsiella pneumoniae - Gram-negative, maltose-fermenting diplococci

Answer: A. Streptococcus pneumoniae - Gram-positive, facultative intracellular, motile bacilli.

Rationale: The symptoms described in the question, such as high-grade fever and poor feeding pattern with regurgitation of milk after each feeding, are consistent with a streptococcal infection, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. The fact that the mother has been consuming only unprocessed foods and unpasteurized dairy during pregnancy may have contributed to the colonization of the infant with this microorganism. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of bacterial infections in infants and can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, vomiting, and difficulty feeding."
798,"Question: A 10-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents due to concerns about his ""strange behavior"". The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is up to date on all vaccines, meeting all developmental milestones. However, he has been displaying increasingly frequent and unprovoked behavioral problems, such as throwing tantrums without responding to punishment or reward, and an unusual obsession with collecting rocks. His teachers report that he spends much of his time daydreaming and is highly skilled at art, able to recreate his favorite cartoon characters with great detail. Upon assessment, the child does not make eye contact and talks incessantly about his rock collection, using normal grammar and vocabulary but with slightly labored speech. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Autism spectrum disorder, level 1 - This is the most likely diagnosis based on the child's symptoms. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. The child's lack of eye contact, obsessive focus on rocks, and difficulty with social interactions are all consistent with ASD. Level 1 ASD refers to the mildest form of the disorder, characterized by subtle difficulties in social interaction and communication.

B. Autism spectrum disorder, level 3 - While the child's symptoms do not fully meet the criteria for level 1 ASD, they are more severe and numerous, indicating a higher level of impairment. Level 3 ASD is characterized by more pronounced difficulties in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors, as well as a greater impact on daily functioning.

C. Tourette’s syndrome - Tourette's syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics, often accompanied by obsessive-compulsive behaviors. While the child's obsession with rocks could be seen as an obsessive-compulsive behavior, the absence of other tic symptoms and the presence of social interaction and communication difficulties suggest that Tourette's syndrome is not the most likely diagnosis.

D. Obsessive compulsive disorder - Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health disorder characterized by recurring, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). While the child's obsession with rocks could be seen as an obsessive behavior, the lack of other symptoms and the presence of social interaction and communication difficulties suggest that OCD is not the most likely diagnosis."
799,"Question: A 38-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his primary care physician for a headache and abdominal pain. His symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and have progressively worsened. He describes his headache as pressure-like and is mildly responsive to ibuprofen. His abdominal pain is located in the bilateral flank area. His hypertension is poorly managed with lifestyle modification and chlorthalidone. He had 1 urinary tract infection that was treated with ciprofloxacin approximately 6 months ago. He has a home blood pressure monitor, where his average readings are 155/95 mmHg. Family history is significant for his father expiring secondary to a myocardial infarction and his history was complicated by refractory hypertension and end-stage renal disease. His vital signs are significant for a blood pressure of 158/100 mmHg. Physical examination is notable for bilateral flank masses. Laboratory testing is significant for a creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL. Urinalysis is remarkable for hematuria and proteinuria. Which of the following will this patient most likely be at risk for developing?

A. Mitral valve prolapse: The patient's history of hypertension and bilateral flank masses on physical examination increase the likelihood of mitral valve prolapse, a condition in which the mitral valve does not close properly, leading to blood flow regurgitation. This can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure, which are common complications of uncontrolled hypertension.

B. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis: This rare condition is characterized by the growth of smooth muscle-like cells in the lungs and other organs, leading to cysts and lung collapse. Although rare, it can occur in individuals with a history of hypertension, and the patient's bilateral flank masses on physical examination suggest the possibility of this condition.

C. Neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor: The patient's history of hypertension and bilateral flank masses may be indicative of a neuroendocrine tumor in the pancreas, which can cause hypertension and other symptoms such as abdominal pain and weight loss.

D. Epilepsy: There is no direct relationship between the patient's history of hypertension and the development of epilepsy. While hypertension can cause seizures in some individuals, this is not a common complication of uncontrolled hypertension."
800,"Sure! Here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 5-day-old male newborn is rushed to the emergency department after a 1-minute seizure episode characterized by blinking, lip-smacking movements, left-sided jerking of the hand and foot, and irritability. The mother reports a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F) at the time of the seizure, and the baby has been having difficulty feeding since yesterday. The baby was born at 39 weeks' gestation and weighed 3189 g (7 lb, 1 oz) at birth, but currently weighs 2980 g (6 lb, 9 oz). The mother's prenatal course was significant for gonorrhea infection diagnosed early in pregnancy and treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin combination therapy. On examination, clusters of vesicular lesions with an erythematous base are present on the baby's face and trunk, and there is profuse lacrimation. Laboratory results show a leukocyte count of 16,200/mm3, with 25% segmented neutrophils, 5% bands, 65% lymphocytes, and 3% monocytes. The baby's serum glucose level is 80 mg/dL. A lumbar puncture is performed, revealing a leukocyte count of 117/μL, a protein concentration of 52 mg/dL, and a glucose concentration of 58 mg/dL. Blood cultures are pending.

802,"Question: A previously healthy 33-year-old woman comes to the emergency department 1 hour after falling from a ladder. She is conscious. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There is no family history of serious illness. Her pulse is 72/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 110/72 mm Hg. Physical examination shows ecchymosis and point tenderness over the right clavicle. An x-ray of the chest shows a nondisplaced fracture of the midshaft of the right clavicle and a 3.5-mm pulmonary nodule in the central portion of the left upper lung field. No previous x-rays of the patient are available. The fracture is treated with pain management and immobilization with a sling. A CT scan of the chest shows that the pulmonary nodule is solid and has well-defined, smooth borders. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient's pulmonary nodule?

A. Reassurance

Reassurance is not the most appropriate next step in management of the patient's pulmonary nodule. The nodule is solid and has well-defined, smooth borders, which suggests that it may be a benign lesion, but further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.

B. Follow-up CT scan of the chest in 6–12 months

A follow-up CT scan of the chest in 6–12 months is an appropriate next step in management of the patient's pulmonary nodule. This will allow for further evaluation of the nodule to determine if it is growing or changing over time, which can help to determine its malignant potential.

C. Follow-up x-ray of the chest in 6–12 months

A follow-up x-ray of the chest in 6–12 months is not the most appropriate next step in management of the patient's pulmonary nodule. X-rays are not as sensitive as CT scans in evaluating pulmonary nodules, and they may not provide sufficient information to determine the nodule's malignant potential.

D. CT-guided transthoracic biopsy

CT-guided transthoracic biopsy is not the most appropriate next step in management of the patient's pulmonary nodule. Biopsy is typically reserved for nodules that are suspicious for malignancy, and the patient's nodule does not have any suspicious features on the CT scan. Additionally, biopsy carries risks such as pneumothorax and bleeding, which may be unnecessary in this case."
803,"Question: A previously healthy 30-year-old woman presents to the physician with four weeks of persistent nervousness and difficulty sleeping, primarily due to her concerns about her relationship and future. She has trouble falling asleep at night because she cannot stop worrying about her boyfriend's perceived flaws, such as not putting dirty dishes in the dishwasher, refusing to add groceries to the shopping list, and suggesting eating at restaurants instead of at home. Despite her love for her boyfriend, she believes she will never be able to tolerate his ""flaws."" Vital signs are normal, and physical examination reveals no abnormalities. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely?

A. Major depressive disorder
B. Generalized anxiety disorder
C. Obsessive-compulsive disorder
D. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder

Answer: D. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.

The patient's preoccupation with her boyfriend's perceived flaws and her belief that she cannot tolerate them suggests a pattern of obsessive thinking and compulsive behavior, which are hallmarks of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). While the patient's symptoms may not meet the full criteria for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, the obsessive preoccupation with her boyfriend's flaws and the belief that she cannot tolerate them are consistent with the diagnostic criteria for OCPD."

805,"Question: A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with chest pain. He was at home watching television when he suddenly felt chest pain that traveled to his back. The patient has a past medical history of alcoholism, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and depression. His temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 123/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Physical exam reveals a S4 on cardiac exam and chest pain that seems to worsen with palpation. The patient smells of alcohol. The patient is started on 100% oxygen and morphine. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

A. CT scan: While a CT scan can help identify the underlying cause of the patient's chest pain, it may not be the best next step in management given the patient's recent alcohol use and potential for alcohol-related injuries.

B. Labetalol: Labetalol is a beta-blocker that can help manage the patient's hypertension and angina, as well as provide some analgesic effects. It is a reasonable next step in management for this patient.

C. Nitroprusside: Nitroprusside is a vasodilator that can help manage hypertension and angina. However, it may not be the best choice for this patient given their recent alcohol use and potential for drug interactions.

D. NPO, IV fluids, serum lipase: While these interventions may be necessary for the patient's management, they are not the best next step in management given the patient's chest pain and recent alcohol use.

Answer: B. Labetalol"

807,"Question: A 21-year-old male presents to the emergency department after falling 20 feet off a construction scaffold, hitting his left side on a railing on the way down, and landing on his left arm. Which of the following interventions should be administered to this patient?

Options:
A. Pneumococcal vaccine: The patient has no significant past medical history or current symptoms suggestive of pneumococcal infection, and therefore, administering the pneumococcal vaccine is not indicated.
B. Prophylactic ceftriaxone: The patient has no signs or symptoms of infection, and prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary in the absence of any documented or suspected infection.
C. Open reduction internal fixation: The patient has a non-displaced left distal radius fracture and non-displaced 9th and 10th rib fractures, which can be managed with open reduction and internal fixation.
D. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN): The patient does not have any indication for TPN, which is a nutritional support modality used in patients who are unable to tolerate oral intake due to illness or injury.

Answer: C. Open reduction internal fixation."
808,"Question: An investigator is studying a drug that acts on a G protein-coupled receptor in the pituitary gland. Binding of the drug to this receptor leads to increased production of inositol triphosphate (IP3) in the basophilic cells of the anterior pituitary. Administration of this drug every 90 minutes is most likely to be beneficial in the treatment of which of the following conditions?

Options:

A. Prostate cancer - This option is not correct because the drug's action on the pituitary gland does not have any direct effect on prostate cancer.

B. Anovulatory infertility - This option is the correct answer. The increased production of IP3 in the pituitary gland caused by the drug can help regulate the menstrual cycle and improve fertility in women with anovulatory infertility.

C. Central diabetes insipidus - This option is not correct because the drug's action on the pituitary gland does not have any direct effect on central diabetes insipidus.

D. Hyperkalemia - This option is not correct because the drug's action on the pituitary gland does not have any direct effect on potassium levels in the body.

Answer: B. Anovulatory infertility"
809,"Question: A 5-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents due to difficulty breathing for the past hour. The parents report noisy breathing and bluish discoloration of their son's lips. During the past two months, the patient has had several upper respiratory tract infections and poor weight gain. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 20th percentile for length and 5th percentile for weight. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 160/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 80/55 mm Hg. Crackles are heard over both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral interstitial infiltrates. Intubation is performed and methylprednisolone is administered. Methenamine silver staining of bronchial lavage fluid shows aggregates of 2 to 8 cysts with central spores. Serum IgA titers are decreased. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?

A. Defective WAS gene
B. Defective CD40 ligand
C. Tyrosine kinase gene mutation
D. Impaired NADPH oxidase

Answer: B. Defective CD40 ligand

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of difficulty breathing, bluish discoloration of the lips, and poor weight gain, along with the presence of bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray, suggest a respiratory infection or inflammation. The methenamine silver staining of bronchial lavage fluid showing aggregates of cysts with central spores is consistent with a diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is caused by a defect in the CD40 ligand, which leads to an abnormal immune response and inflammation in the lungs. The decreased serum IgA titers also support this diagnosis, as IgA deficiency is a common finding in BPD. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition is a defective CD40 ligand."
810,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: The human body obtains vitamin D through diet or sun exposure. However, darker-skinned individuals need more sunlight to produce adequate vitamin D stores due to their higher melanin levels, which act as a natural sunscreen. If these individuals don't get enough sunlight, they need to rely on dietary sources of vitamin D. Which of the following vitamins requires sunlight for its formation?

A. 7-dehydrocholestrol
B. Cholecalciferol (D3) - Correct!
C. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
D. Ergocalciferol (D2)"
811,"Question: A 28-year-old primigravid woman delivers a 4700 g (10 lb 6 oz) boy with bluish discoloration of his lips and fingernails, oxygen saturation of 81%, central cyanosis, a continuous machine-like murmur over the left upper sternal border, and a single S2 heart sound. Which of the following is most likely to be revealed by further evaluation of the mother?

Options:
A. Elevated fasting blood glucose
B. Positive rapid plasma reagin test
C. Prenatal alcohol use
D. Prenatal phenytoin intake

Answer: A. Elevated fasting blood glucose.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a congenital heart defect, which can be caused by genetic or environmental factors during fetal development. Elevated fasting blood glucose is a common finding in gestational diabetes, a condition that can occur during pregnancy and is associated with an increased risk of congenital heart defects. Therefore, further evaluation of the mother is likely to reveal elevated fasting blood glucose."
812,"Question: A 30-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with sudden severe pain in his left ankle, which he experienced while at karate practice. What is the best next step in management?

Options:
A. Change antibiotics and refrain from athletic activities - This option is the best choice as the patient's symptoms suggest a possible ankle sprain or strain, which may be exacerbated by continued athletic activity. Changing the antibiotics to a different class that is more appropriate for a potential bone infection would also be appropriate.
B. Ibuprofen and rest - While ibuprofen may help manage the patient's pain, rest alone may not be sufficient to allow the ankle to heal properly. Continuing to participate in athletic activities without proper evaluation and treatment may lead to a longer recovery time.
C. Orthopedic ankle brace - While an ankle brace may provide support and stability to the ankle, it may not address the underlying cause of the patient's pain.
D. Rehabilitation exercises and activity as tolerated - While rehabilitation exercises may be beneficial in promoting healing and strengthening the ankle, it may not be appropriate to resume athletic activities without proper evaluation and treatment of the underlying cause of the patient's pain."
813,"Question: A 35-year-old man is transferred to the intensive care unit after a motorcycle accident. He does not open his eyes with painful stimuli. He makes no sounds. He assumes decerebrate posture with sternal rub. His right eye is abnormally positioned downward and outward and has a dilated pupil which is not responsive to light. In contrast to this patient's findings, one would expect a patient with a diabetic mononeuropathy of the oculomotor nerve to present in which fashion?

A. Downward and outward gaze, ptosis, and a fixed, dilated pupil
B. Downward and outward gaze with ptosis and a responsive pupil
C. Fixed dilated pupil with normal extraocular movements
D. Inability to abduct the eye

Answer: B. Downward and outward gaze with ptosis and a responsive pupil

Explanation: A patient with a diabetic mononeuropathy of the oculomotor nerve may present with downward and outward gaze, as well as ptosis (drooping of the eyelid). However, the pupil should be responsive to light, unlike the patient in the scenario who has a fixed, dilated pupil that is not responsive to light."
814,"Question: A 29-year-old woman visits her gynecologist for a routine check-up. She is sexually active with multiple partners and occasionally uses condoms for contraception. She does not report any vaginal discharge, burning, itching, or rashes in her inguinal region. The pelvic examination is normal. The results of her routine Pap smear show cellular changes that are attributed to which of the following factors?

Options:
A. Inhibition of p53
B. Activation of p53
C. Activation of Rb
D. Activation of K-Ras

Answer: A. Inhibition of p53

Explanation: The cellular changes seen in the Pap smear are indicative of inhibition of the tumor suppressor protein p53. p53 is a crucial regulator of cellular growth and division, and its inhibition can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation, which can result in the development of abnormal cells in the cervix. This is a common finding in women who are sexually active and do not use contraception consistently, as the constant exposure to new sexual partners can increase the risk of HPV infection and the development of precancerous cells."
815,"Question: A 46-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe pain in his right knee after tripping while descending a staircase. What is the likely cause of his condition?

Options:
A. Meniscal tear: The meniscus is a cartilage structure in the knee joint that can tear due to trauma or wear and tear. However, in this case, the patient's immediate popping sensation and inability to extend or flex his right leg suggest a different diagnosis.

B. Femoral fracture: A fracture of the femur (thigh bone) is a possible cause of knee pain, but the patient's history of obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia increase the likelihood of a soft tissue injury.

C. Quadriceps tendon tear: The quadriceps tendon is a band of tissue that connects the quadriceps muscle to the knee joint. A tear in this tendon can cause knee pain, swelling, and difficulty extending the knee. The patient's history of severe asthma and recent corticosteroid use may have weakened the tendon, making it more susceptible to injury.

D. Avascular necrosis of the femur: Avascular necrosis is a condition where the blood supply to the femur bone is disrupted, leading to bone death. However, the patient's symptoms of sudden onset of knee pain after a fall and the presence of swelling and pain on examination are more consistent with a soft tissue injury.

Answer: C. Quadriceps tendon tear."
816,"Question: A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department following an episode of syncope while getting dressed in the morning. He has never experienced this before and is concerned it may be related to his new job, as he has been unemployed for the past 5 years. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Anxiety - While anxiety can cause lightheadedness and fainting, it is unlikely to be the primary cause of syncope in this case, given the patient's recent onset of symptoms and the fact that they occur only upon getting dressed.
B. Aortic stenosis - This is a less likely diagnosis, as the patient has no history of heart disease and there are no signs of aortic stenosis on examination.
C. Carotid hypersensitivity syndrome - This is the most likely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms of syncope and near-syncope upon getting dressed are consistent with carotid hypersensitivity syndrome, which is caused by irritation or inflammation of the carotid arteries.
D. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy - This is an unlikely diagnosis, as there are no signs of cardiac disease on examination and the patient's symptoms do not suggest a cardiac origin.

Answer: C. Carotid hypersensitivity syndrome."
817,"Question: A 33-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 2-hour history of worsening headache, increased sweating, palpitations, and nausea. She was recently started on venlafaxine for treatment-resistant depression and previously took citalopram for 4 weeks without improvement. She has no history of smoking or alcohol use. Her vital signs are: temperature: 39°C (102.2°F), pulse: 120/min, blood pressure: 150/90 mm Hg. On mental status examination, she is only oriented to person, but not to place or time, with tremors in all extremities and impaired gait. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

A. Abnormal ryanodine receptor
B. Increased CNS serotonergic activity
C. Dopamine receptor blockade
D. Anticholinergic toxicity

Answer: B. Increased CNS serotonergic activity

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of headache, increased sweating, palpitations, and nausea are consistent with serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction that can occur when two or more drugs that affect serotonin levels are taken together. Venlafaxine and citalopram are both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which increase the levels of serotonin in the CNS. The combination of these two drugs, especially when taken recently, can lead to an excessive increase in serotonin levels, resulting in serotonin syndrome. The patient's symptoms of confusion, tremors, and impaired gait are also consistent with this diagnosis."
818,"Question: A 6-day-old infant who was born via uncomplicated vaginal delivery at 39 weeks of gestation is brought to the family physician for poor feeding. The mother received adequate prenatal care throughout the pregnancy, and has no medical conditions. On physical exam, the infant's temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), blood pressure is 70/45 mmHg, pulse is 170/min, and respirations are 40/min. The infant has dry mucous membranes, capillary refill of 4 seconds, and a depressed anterior fontanelle. No abdominal masses are noted. Genital exam shows enlargement of the clitoris with fusion of the labioscrotal folds. Serum chemistry is remarkable for hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. The infant's karyotype is 46,XX. Which of the following findings are most likely to be discovered upon further workup?

A. Increased aldosterone, decreased cortisol
B. Decreased aldosterone, increased 11-deoxycorticosterone
C. Increased sex hormones, increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone
D. Increased sex hormones, decreased renin activity

Answer: C. Increased sex hormones, increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone

Rationale: The clinical presentation of the infant, including the enlargement of the clitoris with fusion of the labioscrotal folds, is consistent with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a genetic disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase. This deficiency leads to excessive production of cortisol and androgens, resulting in the characteristic physical findings and laboratory abnormalities seen in CAH. The increased sex hormones and 17-hydroxyprogesterone in the infant's serum chemistry are consistent with this diagnosis. While hyponatremia and hyperkalemia can occur in CAH, they are not the most likely findings upon further workup."
819,"Question: A 4080-g (9-lb) male newborn is delivered at term to a 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1. Apgar scores are 8 and 9 at 1- and 5-minutes, respectively. Examination in the delivery room shows both feet pointing downwards and inwards. Both the forefeet are twisted medially in adduction, with the hindfeet elevated and the midfeet appearing concave. Both Achilles tendons are taut on palpation. There are skin creases on the medial side of both feet. The deformity persists despite attempts to passively straighten the foot. X-rays of both feet confirm the suspected diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?

A. Foot abduction brace

B. Surgery

C. Repositioning and serial casting

D. Physiotherapy

Answer: C. Repositioning and serial casting

Explanation:
The patient presents with a congenital talipes equinovarus deformity, characterized by both feet pointing downwards and inwards, with the forefeet twisted medially in adduction and the hindfeet elevated. The deformity persists despite attempts to passively straighten the foot, indicating a more severe deformity that may require serial casting and repositioning to correct. Foot abduction braces may be considered for mild cases, but in this instance, surgery or serial casting is the more appropriate next step to achieve proper alignment and prevent long-term complications. Physiotherapy may be considered after correction of the deformity to improve muscle strength and range of motion."
820,"Question:

A 2860-g (6-lb 3-oz) male newborn is born at term to a primigravid woman via spontaneous vaginal delivery. The mother has had no routine prenatal care. She reports that there is no family history of serious illness. The initial examination of the newborn shows bowing of the legs and respiratory distress upon palpation of the chest. The skin and joints are hyperextensible. X-rays of the chest and skull show multiple rib fractures and small, irregular bones along the cranial sutures. Which of the following complications is the newborn at increased risk of?

Options:

A. Costochondral junction enlargement: This condition occurs when the cartilage connecting the ribs to the sternum grows abnormally, causing the chest to be deformed. While it can occur in newborns, it is rare and usually resolves on its own within a few months. Therefore, this option is not the best answer.

B. Intestinal rupture: This is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication that can occur in newborns. It occurs when the intestines are stretched or torn, leading to peritonitis and potentially sepsis. However, the newborn in this scenario does not have any signs of intestinal rupture, so this option is not the best answer.

C. Spinal canal stenosis: This is a condition where the spinal canal narrows, which can cause a variety of neurological symptoms including back pain, muscle weakness, and paralysis. While it can occur in newborns, it is rare and usually occurs in association with other congenital anomalies. Therefore, this option is not the best answer.

D. Hearing loss: This is a potential complication in newborns, particularly those who are born prematurely or with other underlying medical conditions. Hearing loss can occur due to a variety of factors, including genetic disorders, infections, and exposure to loud noises during birth. In this scenario, the newborn's hyperextensible skin and joints, as well as the presence of rib fractures and small, irregular bones along the cranial sutures, suggest that the newborn may be at increased risk of hearing loss. Therefore, this option is the best answer."

822,"Question: A 42-year-old woman presents to her physician with a 6-month history of breast tenderness and menstrual irregularities. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities, and an ultrasound of the pelvis shows a right adnexal mass. A laparoscopic right salpingo-oophorectomy is performed, and histologic examination of the adnexal mass shows small cuboidal cells arranged in clusters surrounding a central cavity with eosinophilic secretions, which resemble primordial follicles. Which of the following laboratory values was most likely increased in this patient at the time of presentation?

A. Estradiol
B. Lactate dehydrogenase
C. α-fetoprotein
D. β-human chorionic gonadotropin

Answer: A. Estradiol

Explanation: The histological examination of the adnexal mass in this patient revealed small cuboidal cells arranged in clusters surrounding a central cavity with eosinophilic secretions, which are similar to primordial follicles. Primordial follicles are the earliest stage of follicle development, and they are characterized by high levels of estrogen production. Therefore, it is likely that the patient's estradiol levels were increased at the time of presentation."

Upon arrival, he is conscious and alert, with no significant vital sign abnormalities. He reports experiencing palpitations, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath before losing consciousness. He takes captopril for hypertension and glyburide for type 2 diabetes mellitus. A random serum glucose concentration is 85 mg/dL, and an ECG shows a short PR interval and a wide QRS complex with initial slurring. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals normal echocardiographic findings with normal left ventricular systolic function. Based on this information, which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's findings?

A. Accessory atrioventricular pathway: The patient's symptoms of palpitations, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath, along with the ECG findings of a short PR interval and a wide QRS complex with initial slurring, are consistent with a accessory atrioventricular pathway. This is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's findings.

B. Ectopic foci within the ventricles: The patient's symptoms and ECG findings do not support the presence of ectopic foci within the ventricles.

C. Low serum glucose levels: The patient's random serum glucose concentration of 85 mg/dL is within the normal range, and does not contribute to the patient's symptoms or ECG findings.

D. A dysfunctional AV node: The patient's symptoms and ECG findings do not support the presence of a dysfunctional AV node."
824,"Question: A 5-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother due to a 1-month history of a painful ulcer on her face. The child has developed painful sunburns in the past with minimal UV exposure. Examination of the skin shows a 2-cm ulcerated nodule on the left cheek, along with scaly, hyperpigmented papules and plaques over the entire body. An ophthalmologic examination reveals decreased visual acuity, clouded corneas, and limbal injection. A biopsy of the facial lesion shows poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Which of the following proteins is most likely responsible for the patient's condition?

A. Excision endonuclease
B. Rb nuclear protein
C. Base-specific glycosylase
D. DNA helicase

Answer: A. Excision endonuclease

Explanation:
The patient's history of developing painful sunburns with minimal UV exposure, along with the presence of a painful ulcer on her face and scaly, hyperpigmented papules and plaques over the entire body, suggests that the patient has xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). XP is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV radiation and a high risk of developing skin cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma. Excision endonuclease is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, which are commonly caused by UV radiation. Mutations in the genes encoding excision endonucleases, such as the XPA gene, can lead to XP and increase the risk of developing skin cancer. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is a mutation in the XPA gene, leading to impaired excision endonuclease activity."
825,"Question: Ten days after the vaginal delivery of a healthy infant girl, a 27-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her husband because of frequent mood changes. She has been tearful and anxious since she went home from the hospital 2 days after delivery. She says that she feels overwhelmed with her new responsibilities and has difficulties taking care of her newborn because she feels constantly tired. She only sleeps for 2 to 3 hours nightly because the baby “is keeping her awake.” Sometimes, the patient checks on her daughter because she thinks she heard her cry but finds her sleeping quietly. Her husband says that she is afraid that something could happen to the baby. She often gets angry at him and has yelled at him when he picks up the baby without using a hand sanitizer beforehand. She breastfeeds the baby without any problems. The patient's mother has bipolar disorder with psychotic features. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows an involuting uterus consistent in size with her postpartum date. Mental status examination shows a labile affect with no evidence of homicidal or suicidal ideation. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 13 g/dL and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 3.1 μU/mL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

C. Reassurance

The patient's symptoms of mood changes, anxiety, and overwhelm are consistent with postpartum depression. While it is important to consider the patient's history of bipolar disorder with psychotic features, the current presentation does not suggest a psychotic episode. The patient's vital signs and mental status examination do not reveal any concerning signs of illness, and the laboratory studies are normal. Given the patient's recent delivery and the challenges of new motherhood, reassurance and support are the most appropriate next step in management. This may involve providing education on postpartum depression, its causes, and its treatment options, as well as offering emotional support and resources for the patient and her family. Sertraline therapy, Risperidone therapy, and Bupropion therapy are not the most appropriate options at this time, as they are not typically used as a first-line treatment for postpartum depression and may have potential risks and side effects that should be carefully considered."
826,"Question: A young woman from the Ohio River Valley in the United States, currently on corticosteroid therapy for ulcerative colitis, presents to a clinic with fever, sweat, headache, non-productive cough, malaise, and general weakness. A chest radiograph reveals patchy pneumonia in the lower lung fields, along with enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Skin changes suggestive of erythema nodosum are noted. Given the patient's location and exposure to someone with similar symptoms, the attending physician suspects a systemic fungal infection may be responsible for the woman's illness. Which of the following laboratory tests can the physician use to detect the disease early and monitor treatment response?

A. Culture method: This method involves growing the fungus in a controlled environment, allowing for the identification of the specific fungal species causing the infection. While cultures can provide valuable information, they may not be as effective in detecting fungal infections early in the course of disease, as the fungus may not yet be present in sufficient quantities to grow in a culture.

B. Antibody testing: This involves measuring the levels of antibodies directed against the fungus in the patient's blood. Antibody tests can help identify the presence of a fungal infection, but they may not be as useful in monitoring treatment response, as antibody levels may not always correlate with the severity of the infection.

C. Fungal staining: This method involves staining tissue samples for the presence of fungal elements, such as hyphae or spores. Fungal staining can help confirm the presence of a fungal infection, but it may not be as sensitive as other diagnostic tests.

D. Antigen detection: This involves measuring the levels of fungal antigens in the patient's body. Antigen detection can provide early detection of fungal infections and can also monitor treatment response, as changes in antigen levels can indicate the effectiveness of therapy. Therefore, the best answer is (D) Antigen detection."
827,"Question: A 67-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. He feels well. His last visit to a physician was 3 years ago. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. Current medications include albuterol, atenolol, lisinopril, and aspirin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 18 years but stopped 20 years ago. He had a right lower extremity venous clot 15 years ago that required 3 months of anticoagulation therapy. A colonoscopy performed 3 years ago demonstrated 2 small, flat polyps that were resected. He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 32.5 kg/m2. His pulse is 85/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. Examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits. Scattered minimal expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. Which of the following health maintenance recommendations is most appropriate at this time?

A. Pulmonary function testing: This is not the most appropriate recommendation at this time, as the patient's lung function has already been evaluated during previous visits and there are no new symptoms or concerns to warrant further testing.

B. Abdominal ultrasonography: Given the patient's history of a right lower extremity venous clot 15 years ago, abdominal ultrasonography may be appropriate to evaluate for any potential underlying vascular issues or to monitor for any recurrent clots.

C. CT scan of the chest: A CT scan of the chest may be appropriate to evaluate the patient's lung tissue and assess for any new or persistent lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or lung cancer.

D. Bone densitometry scan: This is not the most appropriate recommendation at this time, as the patient does not have any risk factors for osteoporosis or bone disease.

Answer: B. Abdominal ultrasonography"
828,"Question: A 29-year-old G1P0 at 23 weeks of gestation presents to the ED with left flank pain migrating to the groin. What is the next best step in management?

Options:
A. Renal radiograph
B. Renal ultrasound
C. Noncontrast CT scan of abdomen and pelvis
D. Exploratory laparoscopy

Answer: B. Renal ultrasound

Rationale:
The patient's symptoms of left flank pain and tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant, along with the presence of blood on inspection of the perineal area, suggest a possible renal calculus or injury. A renal ultrasound would be the next best step in management to evaluate the kidneys and rule out any renal pathology. A renal radiograph may not be able to provide adequate visualization of the kidneys, and a noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis may not be able to identify a renal calculus or injury. Exploratory laparoscopy is not necessary at this point in the patient's evaluation."
829,"Question: A 57-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of crushing substernal chest pain at rest for the past 2 hours. The pain began during an argument with his wife and has since escalated to severe. He has a smoking history of 1 pack per day for 35 years and is diaphoretic. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 21/min, blood pressure 115/65 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Cardiac examination reveals an S4 gallop, and lung examination is clear to auscultation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown below. Based on this information, which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?

Options:
A. Occlusion of the left anterior descending artery
B. Thromboembolism to the right interlobar pulmonary artery
C. Occlusion of the left circumflex artery
D. Tear in the intimal lining of the aorta

Answer: A. Occlusion of the left anterior descending artery.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of substernal chest pain at rest, particularly with a history of smoking, suggest a likelihood of coronary artery disease. The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V2-V3, which is consistent with an occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The S4 gallop on cardiac examination also supports this diagnosis. Thromboembolism to the right interlobar pulmonary artery (option B) is less likely, given the patient's symptoms and the ECG findings. Occlusion of the left circumflex artery (option C) would also cause substernal chest pain, but the ECG findings do not support this diagnosis. Tear in the intimal lining of the aorta (option D) is a rare cause of chest pain and is not supported by the patient's symptoms or the ECG findings."
830,"Question: A 26-year-old woman presents to the physician with painful paresthesias in her foot. Examination reveals decreased sensation in the first interdigital space and a hallux valgus deformity. Which of the following nerves is most likely compressing the patient's paresthesias?

A. Superficial peroneal nerve
B. Deep peroneal nerve
C. Sural nerve
D. Medial plantar nerve

Answer: B. Deep peroneal nerve"
831,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question:

A 68-year-old, overweight gentleman with a 20-pack-year history of smoking presents to the primary care physician with multiple blood-stained tissues after coughing attacks in the last month. His vital signs are within normal limits except for an O2 saturation of 93% on room air. He reports that his cough has continued to worsen over the last 5 years and has never truly improved, and that his shortness of breath has also increased, making it difficult to climb the stairs in his home. What is the most likely cause of his hemoptysis?

Options:

A. Acute pulmonary edema: This is a sudden and severe fluid buildup in the lungs, which can cause shortness of breath, coughing, and chest pain. While it is possible that this could be the cause of the patient's hemoptysis, it is less likely given the patient's history of chronic bronchitis.

B. Lung abscess: A lung abscess is a collection of pus in the lung, which can cause fever, chills, coughing, and chest pain. However, the patient's history of chronic bronchitis suggests that this is also less likely.

C. Chronic bronchitis: This is a chronic inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which can cause coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of blood-stained tissues after coughing attacks suggest that chronic bronchitis is the most likely cause of the hemoptysis.

D. Coagulopathy: This is a condition where the blood's ability to clot is impaired, which can cause bleeding in the lungs. However, the patient's history of smoking and the presence of blood-stained tissues after coughing attacks suggest that coagulopathy is less likely.

Answer: C. Chronic bronchitis."
832,"Question: A 59-year-old man presents to the physician with a 1-year history of increased urinary frequency, weak urinary stream, and occasional straining to void urine. Rectal examination reveals a large, nontender prostate without asymmetry or nodularity. His serum creatinine, prostate-specific antigen, and urinalysis are all within normal limits. A diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is made, and treatment with tamsulosin is initiated. Which of the following changes in intracellular signaling is most likely to occur in response to this drug?

Options:
A. Decreased activity of protein kinase A (PKA)
B. Increased production of diacylglycerol (DAG)
C. Decreased activity of phospholipase C (PLC)
D. Increased activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC)

Answer: C. Decreased activity of phospholipase C (PLC)

Explanation: Tamsulosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist, works by blocking the action of adrenoreceptors in the prostate, leading to relaxation of smooth muscle cells and improvement in urinary symptoms. One of the key intracellular signaling pathways affected by tamsulosin is the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Tamsulosin has been shown to decrease the activity of PLC in prostate smooth muscle cells, leading to decreased intracellular calcium levels and relaxation of smooth muscle fibers. This decrease in PLC activity is thought to contribute to the improvement in urinary symptoms seen in patients with BPH treated with tamsulosin."
833,"Question: The 39-year-old woman presents for a follow-up examination after a colonoscopy revealed 42 hamartomatous polyps. Examine the photograph and select the most likely diagnosis:

Options:
A. Medulloblastoma: A malignant brain tumor that typically affects children, although it can also occur in adults.
B. Pancreatic carcinoma: A malignant tumor that develops in the pancreas, often causing jaundice, abdominal pain, and weight loss.
C. Malignant melanoma: A type of skin cancer that can spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system.
D. Hepatocellular carcinoma: A malignant tumor that develops in the liver, often in people with cirrhosis or liver disease.

Answer: B. Pancreatic carcinoma. The patient's history of colonoscopy and the presence of hamartomatous polyps suggest a possible inherited condition, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer. However, the physical examination findings in the photograph are more consistent with pancreatic cancer, which can also cause jaundice, abdominal pain, and weight loss."
834,"Question:

The researcher is studying gamete production and oogenesis, and for her experiment, she decides to cultivate primary oocytes just prior to ovulation and secondary oocytes just prior to fertilization. When she examines these gametes, she will find that the primary oocytes and secondary oocytes are arrested in which phases of meiosis, respectively?

A. Metaphase I; metaphase II
B. Metaphase I; prophase II
C. Anaphase I; anaphase II
D. Prophase I; metaphase II

Answer: D. Prophase I; metaphase II

Explanation:

The primary oocytes are arrested in prophase I, which is the stage of meiosis where the chromosomes condense and become visible, and the nuclear envelope breaks down. This stage is crucial for the proper separation of chromosomes during meiosis.

On the other hand, the secondary oocytes are arrested in metaphase II, which is the stage of meiosis where the chromosomes line up at the equator of the cell and are ready to separate. This stage is also crucial for the proper separation of chromosomes during meiosis.

Therefore, the primary oocytes and secondary oocytes are arrested in prophase I and metaphase II, respectively, during the process of meiosis."
835,"Question: A 9-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of severe vomiting and increased sleepiness. He experienced high fever and muscle pain about 5 days prior to presentation, and his parents gave him an over-the-counter medication to control the fever at that time. On presentation, he is found to be afebrile though he is still somnolent and difficult to arouse. Physical exam reveals hepatomegaly, and laboratory testing shows the following results:

Alanine aminotransferase: 85 U/L
Aspartate aminotransferase: 78 U/L

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's neurologic changes?

A. Bacterial sepsis
B. Cerebral edema
C. Drug overdose
D. Viral meningitis

Answer: B. Cerebral edema

Rationale: The patient's recent history of fever, muscle pain, and hepatomegaly suggests that he may have a viral or bacterial infection that can cause cerebral edema. The laboratory results also support this diagnosis, as elevated liver enzymes are commonly seen in cases of cerebral edema. Drug overdose and viral meningitis are less likely causes for the patient's symptoms and laboratory results."
836,"Question: An 18-month-old girl is rushed to the emergency department due to the stiffening of her body and unresponsiveness that occurred 1 hour ago. Her symptoms lasted less than 10 minutes. She has had a runny nose for 24 hours without a fever. She had a seizure 6 months ago. Her medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her vaccination schedule is up to date. Her uncle has epilepsy. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F). Physical examination reveals no abnormalities aside from nasal congestion. Which of the following factors best suggests the likelihood of subsequent epilepsy?

Options:
A. Family history of epilepsy
B. Focal seizure
C. History of prior Febrile seizure
D. Seizure within 1 hour of fever onset

Answer: B. Focal seizure

Explanation: A focal seizure occurs when there is abnormal electrical activity in only one part of the brain, and it is a common type of seizure disorder. The occurrence of a focal seizure within 1 hour of fever onset suggests that the seizure may have been caused by the fever, which can sometimes trigger seizures in people with a history of epilepsy. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
837,"Question: A 2720-g (6-lb) female newborn delivered at 35 weeks' gestation starts vomiting and becomes inconsolable 48 hours after birth. The newborn has not passed her first stool yet. Examination shows abdominal distention and high-pitched bowel sounds. A water-soluble contrast enema study shows microcolon. Serum studies show increased levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen. Which of the following is the most likely additional laboratory finding?

Options:

A. Decreased hydrogen ion concentration in renal collecting duct: This is unlikely, as the newborn's vomiting and abdominal distension suggest a gastrointestinal (GI) issue rather than a renal problem.

B. Increased serum calcium concentration: This is unlikely, as the newborn's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with a GI issue than a calcium imbalance.

C. Increased bicarbonate concentration in pancreatic secretions: This is unlikely, as the newborn's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with a GI issue than a pancreatic problem.

D. Increased sodium concentration in sweat: This is the most likely additional laboratory finding, as the newborn's vomiting and abdominal distension suggest a GI issue related to hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood). Hyponatremia can occur in newborns with gastrointestinal problems, such as those caused by microcolon.

Answer: D. Increased sodium concentration in sweat."
838,"Question: The 28-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife due to concerns about his unusual behavior. He has been working excessively at the office and spends most nights at parties, and when he returns home, he demands sex from his wife and sleeps for only 3 hours. He has a history of similar episodes and depression over the past two years and is currently not taking any medications. He appears agitated, keeps jumping up from his seat, and says, ""I have more important things to do."" There is no evidence of suicidal ideation, and the urine toxicology screening is negative. Which of the following parameters should be regularly assessed while the patient is undergoing treatment?

A. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels: As the patient's behavior suggests hyperthyroidism, it is important to monitor TSH levels to assess the effectiveness of lithium treatment and rule out any underlying thyroid disorders.

B. Serum aminotransferases (AST and ALT): These enzymes can be elevated in liver dysfunction, which could be related to the patient's excessive alcohol consumption or other underlying medical conditions. Regular monitoring of these enzymes can help identify any potential liver damage.

C. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential: A CBC can help identify any underlying infections or inflammation, which could contribute to the patient's agitation and unusual behavior. The differential can also help identify any abnormalities in the patient's white blood cell count, which could indicate an underlying condition.

D. Urine culture: While there is no evidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the patient's initial presentation, regular urine cultures can help monitor for any potential bacterial infections that may arise during treatment.

Answer: A. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels."
839,"Question: A 46-year-old man who recently immigrated from Mexico comes to the physician for a pre-employment wellness examination. A tuberculin skin test is administered and he develops a raised, erythematous 12 mm lesion on his forearm within 48 hours. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. He is started on the recommended antibiotic treatment for latent tuberculosis. Four weeks later, he returns for a follow-up examination. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.3 g/dL, serum alanine aminotransferase activity of 86 U/L, and serum aspartate aminotransferase activity of 66 U/L. A photomicrograph of a Prussian blue-stained bone marrow smear is shown. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the drug responsible for this patient's findings?

A. Inhibition of dihydropteroate synthase
B. Binding to 50S ribosomal subunit
C. Inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis
D. Inhibition of arabinosyltransferase

Answer: C. Inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis

Explanation:
The patient's laboratory results, including anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal bone marrow morphology, are consistent with the effects of isoniazid, a drug used to treat latent tuberculosis. Isoniazid inhibits the enzyme mycolic acid synthase, which is essential for the synthesis of mycolic acids, a component of the mycobacterial cell wall. This inhibition leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites and ultimately causes cell death in the bone marrow, liver, and other organs. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the drug responsible for the patient's findings is inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis."
840,"Question: A 68-year-old woman in a wheelchair presents with her husband. She has a 12-month history of progressive difficulty in walking and maintaining balance. Her husband reports that she walks slowly, has difficulty turning, and her feet seem ‘glued to the ground’. She also has problems recalling names and details of recent events. She has no tremors, delusions, hallucinations, sleep disturbances, or head trauma. Past medical history is significant for essential hypertension treated with losartan and urinary incontinence, for which she takes oxybutynin. On physical examination, her vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 130/70 mm Hg, and pulse 80/min. On neurologic examination, her gait is slow, with short steps and poor foot clearance. A head CT is shown. The patient undergoes a lumbar puncture to remove 50 ml of cerebrospinal fluid, which transiently improves her gait for the next 3 days. What is the next step in the management of this patient?

A. Acetazolamide

B. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy

C. Epidural blood patch

D. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt

Answer: D. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of progressive difficulty in walking and maintaining balance, along with her husband's report of her feet seeming 'glued to the ground', suggest a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The transient improvement in gait after lumbar puncture suggests that the patient may have hydrocephalus, a common complication of Parkinson's disease. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is a common treatment for hydrocephalus, and it is the next step in the management of this patient. Acetazolamide is not a treatment for hydrocephalus, endoscopic third ventriculostomy is a surgical procedure that is not typically used for hydrocephalus, and epidural blood patch is not relevant to the patient's symptoms."
841,"Question: A 17-year-old girl presents to her primary care physician for a wellness checkup. The patient is currently doing well in school and plays soccer. She has a past medical history of childhood obesity that was treated with diet and exercise. The patient states that her menses have not changed, and they occur every 1 to 3 months. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 127/70 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's BMI at this visit is 22.1 kg/m^2. On physical exam, the patient is in no distress. You note acne present on her face, shoulders, and chest. You also note thick, black hair on her upper lip and chest. The patient's laboratory values are seen as below.

Hemoglobin: 14 g/dL
Hematocrit: 42%
Leukocyte count: 7,500/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 177,000/mm^3

Serum:
Na+: 137 mEq/L
Cl-: 101 mEq/L
K+: 4.4 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
BUN: 27 mg/dL
Glucose: 90 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.1 mg/dL
Testosterone: 82 ng/dL
17-hydroxyprogesterone: elevated
AST: 12 U/L
ALT: 10 U/L

Which of the following is associated with this patient's most likely diagnosis?

A. Deficiency of 11-hydroxylase
B. Deficiency of 17-hydroxylase
C. Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase
D. Malignancy

Answer: C. Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase

The patient's elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone level and normal 11-hydroxyprogesterone level suggest a deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, which is the enzyme responsible for converting 17-hydroxyprogesterone to cortisol. This is a common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a genetic disorder that affects the production of cortisol and aldosterone hormones by the adrenal glands. The patient's acne and black hair on her upper lip and chest are also consistent with CAH."
842,"Question: A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician due to recurring early morning headaches for the past 6 months, accompanied by severe nausea, occasional vomiting, difficulty walking, and intermittent double vision. Examination reveals normal muscle strength, 2+ deep tendon reflexes bilaterally, a broad-based gait, and impaired tandem gait. Fundoscopy shows bilateral swelling of the optic disc and esotropia of the left eye. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely?

Options:
A. Schwannoma
B. Hemangioblastoma
C. Meningioma
D. Medulloblastoma

Answer: D. Medulloblastoma.

The boy's symptoms, including headaches, nausea, difficulty walking, and double vision, are consistent with a brain tumor, specifically medulloblastoma. The fundoscopic examination showing bilateral swelling of the optic disc and esotropia of the left eye also support this diagnosis. Medulloblastoma is a type of pediatric brain cancer that typically affects children aged 5-10 years old, and it is the most common type of central nervous system tumor in this age group. While the other options (Schwannoma, Hemangioblastoma, and Meningioma) can also occur in the brain, they are less likely to cause the specific symptoms presented in this case."
843,"Question: A 75-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after an episode of being unconscious. He was playing with his 3-year-old granddaughter when he suddenly fell down and was unresponsive for 1 minute. He responded normally after regaining consciousness. He has had episodes of mild chest pain and abdominal discomfort for the past 2 months, especially while working on his car. He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He appears alert. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 89/min and regular, and blood pressure is 110/88 mm Hg. Examination shows a 3/6 late systolic murmur at the right sternal border that radiates to the carotids. There is no swelling or erythema of the lower extremities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

A. Fibrosis of the sinus node
B. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy
C. Calcification of the aortic valve
D. Embolus in the pulmonary artery

Answer: C. Calcification of the aortic valve

Rationale: The patient's history of mild chest pain and abdominal discomfort, especially while working on his car, suggests that he may have atherosclerosis or calcification of the aortic valve, which can cause symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. The patient's age and history of hypertension also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. The other options are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms based on the information provided."
844,"Question: A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden change in behavior, including confusion, apathy, and muscle twitches. He recently returned from a trip to rural Mexico and had episodes of bloody diarrhea. What is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation?

Options:
A. Blood in the subarachnoid space
B. Multifocal infarction on MRI
C. Sharp wave complexes on EEG
D. Tear of a bridging vein

Answer: C. Sharp wave complexes on EEG.

Rationale: The patient's sudden change in behavior, including confusion and apathy, along with the muscle twitches, are consistent with a diagnosis of encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain. Sharp wave complexes are a common EEG finding in encephalitis and are characterized by a distinctive pattern of sharp, wave-like discharges on the EEG. While blood in the subarachnoid space, multifocal infarction on MRI, and tear of a bridging vein are also possible diagnoses, they are less likely given the patient's presentation."
845,"Question: An 8-year-old girl is brought to the emergency room for a 6-hour history of fever, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing. Physical examination shows pooling of oral secretions and inspiratory stridor. Lateral x-ray of the neck shows thickening of the epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds. Throat culture with chocolate agar shows small, gram-negative coccobacilli. The patient's brother is started on the recommended antibiotic for chemoprophylaxis. Which of the following is the primary mechanism of action of this drug?

Options:

A. Inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase
B. Inhibition of the 50S ribosomal subunit
C. Inhibition of prokaryotic topoisomerase II
D. Inhibition of the 30S ribosomal subunit

Answer: A. Inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase

Explanation: The drug used for chemoprophylaxis in this case is likely to inhibit the growth of the bacteria causing the infection by interfering with their ability to produce proteins essential for their survival. DNA-dependent RNA polymerase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of RNA molecules in bacteria, and its inhibition can lead to a decrease in the production of essential proteins, ultimately resulting in the death of the bacteria. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
846,"Question: A 49-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a general check-up, 20 years after her last visit. She has no medical history of breast cancer, but her friend was recently diagnosed. Her temperature is 97.0°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 114/64 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate workup for breast cancer for this patient?

A. BRCA genetic testing: This option is not appropriate for this patient, as she does not have a family history of breast cancer or other genetic mutations that would increase her risk.

B. Mammography: Mammography is the most appropriate imaging test for breast cancer screening in this patient, as she is 49 years old and has no prior mammography history. It can help detect any early signs of breast cancer and reduce the risk of advanced cancer stages.

C. No intervention indicated at this time: This option is the correct answer, as the patient has no symptoms or medical history of breast cancer, and a mammography is the only appropriate intervention at this time.

D. Ultrasound: This option is not appropriate for this patient, as ultrasound is not a reliable method for detecting breast cancer in women without any symptoms or abnormalities.

Answer: C. No intervention indicated at this time."
847,"Question: A 40-year-old South Asian male presents to a primary care provider with a chronic cough that worsens at night, along with recent weight loss and darker stools. He attributes these symptoms to difficulties adjusting to a Western diet after recently moving to the United States for work in construction. He denies any difficulty swallowing or feeling of food getting stuck in his throat, and he drinks alcohol once or twice per week. He has never smoked and does not have a family history of cancer. On physical exam, his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezing, and his abdomen is soft and non-distended with no tenderness to palpation. He expresses concern about missing work and requests medication for his cough. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

A. Helicobacter pylori stool antigen test: This test is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms suggestive of a gastrointestinal infection or ulcer.

B. Barium swallow: A barium swallow is not typically recommended for patients with a chronic cough, as it is primarily used to evaluate swallowing difficulties or abnormalities in the esophagus.

C. Upper endoscopy: Given the patient's recent weight loss, darker stools, and concern about gastrointestinal symptoms, an upper endoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management. This will allow for visualization of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum for any signs of inflammation, ulcers, or other abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

D. Colonoscopy: A colonoscopy is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms suggestive of colonic disease or cancer.

Answer: C. Upper endoscopy"
848,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question:
A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with acute left lower quadrant abdominal pain and fever of 1 day duration. He has also experienced weight loss and decreased appetite over the past week. The patient had surgery for a ruptured Achilles tendon 1 month ago and is still recovering, but otherwise, he is healthy. On examination, he appears uncomfortable and thin with tenderness in the left lower quadrant without rebound tenderness. A fecal occult blood test is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:
A. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole
B. Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole
C. CT abdomen
D. MRI abdomen

Answer: C. CT abdomen

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of acute abdominal pain and positive fecal occult blood test suggest the possibility of an inflammatory process in the abdomen, which could be caused by an infectious or inflammatory condition such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or abscess. A CT abdomen would provide better imaging resolution than a fecal occult blood test alone to identify the source of the infection and guide further management. While ceftriaxone and metronidazole are effective antibiotics against common bacterial pathogens, they may not be sufficient to treat an inflammatory or abscess in the abdomen. Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole are also effective against a wide range of bacteria, but they may not be the best choice for treating an inflammatory or abscess in the abdomen. MRI abdomen may not be as useful in this case as it may not provide as much anatomical detail as CT abdomen."
849,"Question: A 72-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden vision loss in her left eye. She experienced a gradual decrease in vision over a few minutes, followed by complete loss of vision for about 10 minutes, after which it returned to normal. She did not experience any pain or other symptoms. Her medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. When you listen to her neck with a stethoscope, you hear a high-pitched sound. Her physical exam is otherwise normal, and her vision is currently 20/30 in both eyes. Which anatomical location is most likely the source of her symptoms?

Options:

A. Carotid artery: The carotid artery is a major blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain and is located near the temple. The woman's symptoms of sudden vision loss and the high-pitched sound heard on examination suggest that the carotid artery may be the source of her problem.

B. Left atrium: The left atrium is a chamber of the heart that receives blood from the lungs. While the woman's symptoms do not suggest any cardiac issues, it is possible that a cardiac condition could be causing her vision problems.

C. Temporal artery: The temporal artery is located near the temple and supplies blood to the brain. The woman's sudden vision loss and the location of the high-pitched sound on examination suggest that the temporal artery may be the source of her problem.

D. Vertebral artery: The vertebral artery is a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain and is located in the neck. While the woman's symptoms do not suggest any issues with the vertebral artery, it is possible that a blockage or other problem in this vessel could be causing her vision loss.

Answer: A. Carotid artery."
850,"Question: A 39-year-old African American woman is admitted to the hospital following a seizure with a severe post-ictal headache. She was diagnosed with breast cancer 1 year ago when she presented with a hard, rock-like, immobile mass with irregular borders accompanied by changes in the breast skin, including erythema and dimpling. She had ipsilateral mobile axillary lymphadenopathy at that time. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of stage 2B invasive breast cancer. Her mother died at 42 years of age due to the same type of breast cancer. A CT scan done during this admission reveals multiple metastatic lesions in the brain and liver, along with the involvement of supra- and infra-clavicular lymph nodes. Which of the following molecular profile most likely characterizes this patient?

A. Progesterone receptor (PR) positive

B. ER, PR, HER2 negative

C. PR, ER, HER2 positive

D. HER2 positive

Answer: B. ER, PR, HER2 negative

Rationale: The patient's history of breast cancer diagnosis and the presence of metastatic lesions in the brain and liver suggest that the cancer is hormone receptor-negative (HR-negative). The patient's mother also died of the same type of breast cancer, which is commonly seen in HR-negative tumors. The presence of ipsilateral mobile axillary lymphadenopathy at the time of initial diagnosis also supports this molecular profile.

Option A, PR positive, is less likely as the patient's tumor was HR-negative at the time of initial diagnosis and the presence of metastatic lesions in the brain and liver suggests that the cancer has progressed despite hormonal therapy.

Option C, PR, ER, HER2 positive, is also less likely as the patient's tumor was HR-negative at the time of initial diagnosis and the presence of metastatic lesions in the brain and liver suggests that the cancer has progressed despite hormonal therapy.

Option D, HER2 positive, is not supported by the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings, as there is no evidence of HER2 amplification or overexpression in the tumor."
851,"Sure! Here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 24-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus is rushed to the emergency department due to weakness, abdominal pain, nausea, and one episode of vomiting over the past day. He has not taken his insulin for 3 days. His pulse is 125 beats per minute and respirations are 29 breaths per minute. Examination reveals dry mucous membranes, and his breath has a fruity odor. Which of the following sets of laboratory values is most likely to be observed in the urine obtained before treatment?

Options:

A. Acidic urine with low bicarbonate levels, elevated ammonia, and increased potassium levels.
B. Normal urine pH with normal bicarbonate, ammonia, and potassium levels.
C. Alkaline urine with normal bicarbonate levels, low ammonia, and normal potassium levels.
D. Acidic urine with high bicarbonate levels, normal ammonia, and decreased potassium levels.

Answer: A. Acidic urine with low bicarbonate levels, elevated ammonia, and increased potassium levels."
852,"Question: An 18-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination with his parents, who are concerned about a swelling on his back that has been present for 7 months. The patient has a history of using intravenous heroin but has not used any illicit drugs for the past 2 months. There is no personal or family history of serious illness, and vital signs are within normal limits. Examination reveals a 2-cm soft, lobulated, mobile swelling on the right side of his upper back that slips away from the fingers when palpated. Healed track marks are present in the bilateral cubital fossae. The patient is told that the mass on his back is likely a lipoma, a benign fatty tumor that does not require treatment. However, the patient wants it removed for cosmetic reasons. Four months ago, he asked another physician to remove it but the physician refused. The patient is counseled about the potential benefits and risks of the excision and the possibility of recurrence. His parents do not want the excision to be performed, but the patient insists. What is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Perform the excision - The patient has expressed a clear desire to have the mass removed for cosmetic reasons, and while the physician should take the parents' concerns into account, the patient's autonomy and right to make decisions about their own body should also be respected.

B. Refer to the hospital ethics committee - This option is not relevant in this scenario, as the issue is not a complex ethical dilemma but rather a disagreement between the patient and his parents regarding the best course of action.

C. Refer him to a methadone clinic - This option is not appropriate, as the patient does not have a substance use disorder and does not require treatment for drug addiction.

D. Request parental consent - This option is not appropriate, as the patient is an adult and has the right to make decisions about their own body. While the parents may have concerns about the excision, the patient has expressed a clear desire to undergo the procedure, and their consent should be obtained."
853,"Question: A 23-year-old woman visits a dermatologist for treatment of her acne, which has caused her to feel self-conscious and avoid social situations. She has tried various face creams and scar removal products without success. On examination, she has pustular acne on her cheeks and forehead. The dermatologist prescribes isotretinoin, a powerful oral medication. Which of the following medications would you recommend in combination with isotretinoin to enhance its effectiveness?

Options:
A. Oral contraceptives: Oral contraceptives, also known as birth control pills, contain hormones that have anti-inflammatory properties, which may help reduce acne. However, they may also increase the risk of blood clots and other side effects, so their use with isotretinoin should be carefully evaluated.
B. Folic acid: Folic acid is a B vitamin that has been shown to have a positive effect on acne. It may help reduce inflammation and promote healthy skin. However, its effectiveness in combination with isotretinoin has not been well-studied, so its use in this context may not be recommended.
C. Antihypertensives: Antihypertensives, or blood pressure medications, have been shown to have a beneficial effect on acne. They may help reduce inflammation and improve blood flow to the skin, which can help the body heal and repair damaged skin. However, their use with isotretinoin may increase the risk of side effects, so careful monitoring is necessary.
D. Vitamin B6: Vitamin B6 is an essential nutrient that has been suggested to have a positive effect on acne. It may help reduce inflammation and promote healthy skin. However, its effectiveness in combination with isotretinoin has not been well-studied, so its use in this context may not be recommended.

Answer: A. Oral contraceptives. While all of the options listed may have some potential benefits for acne treatment, oral contraceptives are the most well-studied and recommended in combination with isotretinoin. It is important to consult with a dermatologist to determine the best course of treatment for individual cases."
854,"Question: A 73-year-old male presents to the emergency department with several days of fevers, cough producing mucopurulent sputum, and pleuritic chest pain. He has not seen a doctor in 30 years due to a lack of illness. His vital signs are: T 101°F, HR 98, BP 100/55, RR 31. On physical exam, he is confused and has decreased breath sounds and crackles on the lower left lobe. Gram-positive diplococci are seen in the sputum. Which of the following is the most appropriate management for his pneumonia?

A. Oral Penicillin V and outpatient follow-up
B. IV Penicillin G and inpatient admission
C. Azithromycin and outpatient follow-up
D. Levofloxacin and outpatient follow-up

Answer: B. IV Penicillin G and inpatient admission

Rationale: The patient's age, confusion, and decreased breath sounds and crackles on the lower left lobe suggest a severe case of pneumonia that requires hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. Oral penicillin may not be effective in treating this type of pneumonia, and azithromycin is not recommended for severe pneumonia. Levofloxacin is also not the first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia, which is what this patient likely has. IV penicillin G is the most appropriate choice for treating pneumonia in a hospital setting, especially in an elderly patient with severe symptoms. Inpatient admission is necessary to monitor the patient's condition closely and provide appropriate treatment."
855,"Question: A 22-year-old woman returns to the doctor for a follow-up examination after a spontaneous abortion 3 months ago. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago, and she has been feeling sad occasionally but has continued working and socializing. She does not have any suicidal thoughts or tendencies, and she does not smoke. Her vital signs are normal, and a physical examination and pelvic examination show no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is negative, and she is started on combined oral contraceptive pills to avoid pregnancy in the near future. Which of the following conditions is the patient at risk of developing?

A. Functional ovarian cysts: The patient is at low risk of developing functional ovarian cysts due to her young age and recent spontaneous abortion. Functional ovarian cysts are more common in women over 35 years old and those with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease.

B. Acne: The patient is not at risk of developing acne, as it is a skin condition unrelated to reproductive health.

C. Endometriosis: The patient is not at risk of developing endometriosis, as it is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, and there are no symptoms or signs of endometriosis in this case.

D. Hypertension: The patient is at low risk of developing hypertension, as she does not have any risk factors for hypertension, such as obesity, family history of hypertension, or a history of smoking.

Answer: D. Hypertension."
856,"Question: A 48-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of an itchy rash on his trunk, waistline, and forearms. He has no prior skin conditions and recently had an upper respiratory infection that resolved with over-the-counter medication. He has type I diabetes mellitus well-controlled with insulin and hypertension treated with captopril. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 120/85 mm Hg. Examination reveals nontender rashes on his trunk, waistline, and forearms that blanch on pressure. There is no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient's skin findings?

A. Epidermal keratinocyte hyperproliferation: This condition is characterized by an abnormal proliferation of keratinocytes in the epidermis, leading to the formation of keratoses or warts. However, the patient's rash does not appear to be caused by this condition, as it is not characterized by the typical scaly or rough texture of keratinocyte hyperproliferation.

B. Cutaneous Trichophyton rubrum infection: Trichophyton rubrum is a type of fungus that can cause skin infections, including ringworm. However, the patient's rash does not appear to be caused by this fungus, as it is not characterized by the typical circular or ring-shaped lesions of cutaneous Trichophyton rubrum infection.

C. Impaired bradykinin degradation: Bradykinin is a peptide that can cause vasodilation and increased permeability of blood vessels, leading to skin symptoms such as itching and flushing. However, the patient's rash does not appear to be caused by impaired bradykinin degradation, as there is no evidence of systemic symptoms such as flushing or swelling.

D. Cutaneous mast cell activation: Mast cells are immune cells that play a role in the immune response and can cause skin symptoms such as itching, redness, and swelling. The patient's rash appears to be caused by cutaneous mast cell activation, as it is characterized by the typical distribution of nontender, blanching lesions on the trunk, waistline, and forearms."
857,"Question: A 67-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of fever, chills, headache, and fatigue. He appears ill. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Analysis of nasal secretions shows infection with an enveloped, single-stranded segmented RNA virus. In response to infection with this pathogen, certain cells present antigens from the pathogen to CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Which of the following statements about the molecules used for the presentation of these antigens is most accurate?

Options:

A. The antigens are loaded onto the molecule within lysosomes
B. The molecule consists of a heavy chain associated with β2 microglobulin
C. The molecule is made up of 2 chains of equal length
D. The molecule is selectively expressed by antigen-presenting cells

Answer: B. The molecule consists of a heavy chain associated with β2 microglobulin

Explanation:
The molecule used for antigen presentation in this scenario is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. MHC molecules are responsible for presenting antigens to T-lymphocytes, and they are made up of a heavy chain and a light chain. The heavy chain is associated with β2 microglobulin, which is a protein that helps to present the antigen to the T-lymphocyte. Therefore, option B is the most accurate statement about the molecules used for antigen presentation in this scenario.

Option A is incorrect because antigens are not loaded onto the molecule within lysosomes. Lysosomes are organelles that contain digestive enzymes and are involved in the degradation of cellular waste and foreign substances.

Option C is incorrect because the molecule is not made up of 2 chains of equal length. MHC molecules have a heavy chain and a light chain, and the heavy chain is associated with β2 microglobulin.

Option D is incorrect because the molecule is not selectively expressed by antigen-presenting cells. MHC molecules are expressed on the surface of many different cell types, including antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages."

During the neurological examination, the patient exhibits decreased sensation over the right thigh, with muscle strength of 2/5 in the right lower extremity and 4/5 in the right upper extremity. The patient's face remains normal, but they struggle to initiate sentences and are unable to write their name. The most likely cause of this patient's condition is an obstruction of which major blood vessel?

Options:
A. Right anterior cerebral artery
B. Right vertebrobasilar artery
C. Left posterior cerebral artery
D. Left anterior cerebral artery

Answer: D. Left anterior cerebral artery"
859,"Question: A 32-year-old man presents to the emergency room for a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. After stabilizing the patient, a full radiologic evaluation reveals multiple contrast-enhancing lesions in the brain, lungs, and liver. According to his wife, he lost several pounds in the last few months. The medical history is relevant for cryptorchidism, with abdominal testes that were surgically transferred to the scrotum just before he turned 1-year old. His lab investigation reveals:

α-fetoprotein: 9 ng/mL (normal values < 10 ng/mL)
Human chorionic gonadotropin: 1,895 IU/L (normal values < 0.5 IU/L)

Which of the following microscopic features best describes the lesions seen in this patient's imaging study?

A. Glomerulus-like structure with a mesoderm core, a central capillary, and lined with germ cells
B. Germ cells with well-defined borders, central nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and clear cytoplasm
C. Cells with hyaline-like globules
D. Intimate association of syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells

Answer: D. Intimate association of syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells

Explanation:

The patient's elevated α-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin levels, along with the presence of multiple contrast-enhancing lesions in the brain, lungs, and liver, suggest a possible germ cell tumor. The microscopic features of the lesions in the patient's imaging study are consistent with a yolk sac tumor, which is a type of germ cell tumor that arises from the embryonic yolk sac. The intimate association of syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells is a characteristic feature of yolk sac tumors. Therefore, option D is the best answer."
860,"Question: A 64-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with severe, whole-body itching. She has a history of joint swelling and pain, redness, burning pain, and swelling of her hands and feet, and was recently diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. What is the best next step in treating her underlying condition?

Options:

A. Diphenhydramine - Incorrect. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that may provide temporary relief for itching, but it is not a treatment for the underlying condition.

B. Hydroxyurea - Correct. Hydroxyurea is a medication that is used to treat certain blood disorders, including polymyalgia rheumatica, which is a condition that can cause joint pain and swelling. It may be effective in treating the patient's underlying condition.

C. Febuxostat - Incorrect. Febuxostat is a medication that is used to treat gout, which is a condition that causes joint pain and swelling. While it may be effective in treating the patient's underlying condition, it is not the best next step in treatment.

D. Prednisone - Incorrect. Prednisone is a steroid medication that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including inflammation and swelling. While it may provide temporary relief for itching and joint pain, it is not the best next step in treating the patient's underlying condition.

Answer: B. Hydroxyurea."
861,"Question: A 80-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department from a senior living home with a chief complaint of acute onset and severe abdominal pain with 5 episodes of bloody diarrhea. She has a history of having chronic constipation, and postprandial abdominal pain which subsides after taking nitroglycerin. The abdominal pain that she is currently experiencing did not subside using her medication. A week ago, she had a percutaneous intervention for an inferior wall STEMI. On physical examination, the patient looks pale and confused. The vital signs include: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 108/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature 35.6°C (96.0°F). The patient receives an aggressive treatment consisting of intravenous fluids and vasopressors, and she is transferred to the ICU. Despite all the necessary interventions, the patient dies. During the autopsy, a dark hemorrhagic appearance of the sigmoid colon is noted. What is the most likely pathology related to her death?

A. Transmural infarction

The most likely pathology related to the patient's death is transmural infarction. This is because the dark hemorrhagic appearance of the sigmoid colon observed during the autopsy suggests that there is a complete obstruction of blood flow to the colon, resulting in infarction of the colonic tissue. Transmural infarction is a serious complication of acute abdominal pain and can lead to rapid deterioration and death if left untreated. The patient's history of chronic constipation and recent percutaneous intervention for an inferior wall STEMI also support this diagnosis.

B. Mucosal infarct

Mucosal infarct is a less likely possibility, as it typically occurs due to a temporary occlusion of a blood vessel in the colonic mucosa, leading to ischemia of the colonic tissue. While the patient's history of chronic constipation may increase the risk of mucosal infarct, the severity and rapid progression of the abdominal pain, as well as the dark hemorrhagic appearance of the sigmoid colon observed during the autopsy, suggest that transmural infarction is a more likely explanation for the patient's death.

C. Toxic megacolon

Toxic megacolon is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of acute abdominal pain that can occur in patients with ulcerative colitis or other inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the patient's history of chronic constipation and recent percutaneous intervention for an inferior wall STEMI do not support this diagnosis. Additionally, the dark hemorrhagic appearance of the sigmoid colon observed during the autopsy is not typical of toxic megacolon.

D. Adenocarcinoma

Adenocarcinoma is a malignancy that can occur in the colon, but it is not a likely explanation for the patient's death in this scenario. The patient's age and medical history do not suggest a high risk of malignancy, and the autopsy findings do not indicate the presence of any malignant tumors in the colon."
862,"Question: A 57-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 presents for a routine follow-up. His blood glucose levels have been inconsistently controlled with metformin and lifestyle modifications since his diagnosis 3 years ago. He is currently on metformin and diet control with exercise. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure of 122/82 mm Hg, pulse of 83/min, temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), and respiratory rate of 10/min. At this current visit, the urinalysis results are as follows: pH 6.2, color light yellow, RBC none, WBC none, protein 4+, cast RBC casts, glucose absent, crystal none, ketone absent, and nitrite absent. The 24-hour urine protein excretion is 3.7 g. The urine albumin loss mapping shows: urine albumin loss/24h current: 215 mg, urine albumin loss/24h 3 months ago: 28 mg. The blood sugar analysis shows: fasting blood sugar 153 mg/dL, post-prandial blood sugar 225 mg/dL, and HbA1c 7.4%. Which of the following best describes the expected microscopic finding on renal biopsy?

A. Normal kidney biopsy; no pathological finding is evident at this time
B. Glomerular hypertrophy with slight glomerular basement membrane thickening
C. Significant global glomerulosclerosis
D. Glomerular basement membrane thickening and mesangial expansion

Answer: D. Glomerular basement membrane thickening and mesangial expansion.

Explanation: The urine albumin loss mapping and blood sugar analysis results suggest that the patient has diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is characterized by the loss of large amounts of albumin in the urine. The glomerular basement membrane thickening and mesangial expansion observed on renal biopsy are consistent with the pathological changes seen in DKD. Glomerular hypertrophy and significant global glomerulosclerosis are less likely to be observed in the early stages of DKD, while the absence of any other pathological findings on renal biopsy suggests that the patient's kidney disease is primarily due to DKD."
863,"Question: A 19-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder and an unknown cardiac arrhythmia presents with palpitations and chest pain. She admits to taking lithium and procainamide regularly, but she ran out of medication 2 weeks ago and has not been able to get refills. Her family history is significant for bipolar disorder in her mother and maternal aunt. Her vital signs include blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, pulse 110/min, respiratory rate 18/min. Physical examination is significant for a widely split first heart sound with a holosystolic murmur loudest over the left sternal border. Visible cyanosis is noted in the lips and nailbeds. An electrocardiogram is performed which shows intermittent supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with a right bundle branch block. Her cardiac enzymes are normal. An echocardiogram is performed, which shows evidence of a dilated right atria with portions of the tricuspid valve displaced towards the apex. Which of the following medications was this patient most likely exposed to prenatally?

A. Mood stabilizer - The patient's history of bipolar disorder and exposure to lithium and procainamide during pregnancy suggest that she may have been exposed to a mood stabilizer prenatally. Lithium is a common mood stabilizer used to treat bipolar disorder, and it is known to cross the placenta and reach the developing fetus. Procainamide is also a mood stabilizer that is sometimes used to treat bipolar disorder, although it is less commonly used than lithium.

B. Antidepressant - While the patient's history of bipolar disorder and exposure to lithium and procainamide suggest that she may have been exposed to a mood stabilizer prenatally, it is also possible that she was exposed to an antidepressant during pregnancy. Some antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can cross the placenta and reach the developing fetus. However, the patient's history of bipolar disorder and the presence of a cardiac arrhythmia suggest that a mood stabilizer may be a more likely explanation for her condition.

C. Insulin - Insulin is a medication that is used to treat diabetes, but it is not a medication that is typically used during pregnancy. The patient's history of bipolar disorder and exposure to lithium and procainamide do not suggest that she was exposed to insulin prenatally.

D. Antihypertensive - Antihypertensive medications are used to treat high blood pressure, but they are not typically used during pregnancy. The patient's history of bipolar disorder and exposure to lithium and procainamide do not suggest that she was exposed to an antihypertensive medication prenatally.

In conclusion, based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, it is most likely that she was exposed to a mood stabilizer, such as lithium or procainamide, prenatally."
864,"Question: A 48-year-old woman presents with severe chest pain for 2 hours, accompanied by an episode of severe retching and bloody vomiting, which preceded the onset of chest pain. She reports having had an episode of binge drinking last night. The patient's vital signs are as follows: blood pressure: 110/68 mm Hg, pulse: 90/min, respiratory rate: 18/min, and oxygen saturation: 90% on room air. An ECG is unremarkable, and the cardiovascular examination is normal. Crepitus is heard over the left lower lobe of the lung. Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, which of the following is the most likely etiology of her symptoms?

A. Linear laceration at the gastroesophageal junction: This is unlikely, as there are no signs of trauma or injury to the gastroesophageal junction.

B. Horizontal partition in the tunica media of the aorta: This is also unlikely, as there are no signs of aortic dissection or injury.

C. Rupture of the esophagus due to increased intraluminal pressure: This is the most likely etiology of the patient's symptoms. The patient's history of binge drinking and the presence of crepitus over the left lower lobe of the lung are consistent with esophageal rupture due to increased intraluminal pressure, which can occur as a result of alcohol-induced inflammation and edema.

D. Helicobacter pylori infection: This is an unrelated condition that is not likely to cause the patient's symptoms.

Answer: C. Rupture of the esophagus due to increased intraluminal pressure."
865,"Question: A study is funded by the tobacco industry to investigate the association between smoking and lung cancer. They design a prospective cohort study of 1,000 smokers aged 20-30 over five years. After the study period ends, they find no association between smoking and lung cancer. Which of the following study features is most likely to have led to the failure to detect an association between tobacco use and cancer?

Options:
A. Effect modification
B. Latency period
C. Pygmalion effect
D. Confounding

Answer: B. Latency period

Explanation: The latency period refers to the time it takes for the effects of a risk factor, in this case, smoking, to manifest as cancer. If the latency period is longer than the duration of the study, it may be difficult to detect an association between smoking and cancer, even if one exists. In this case, the study may have failed to note an association between tobacco use and cancer due to the longer latency period between smoking and the development of lung cancer."
866,"Question: A 37-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by police after being found naked outside a government building. She is accompanied by her husband who reports that she has been having ""crazy"" ideas. The patient's speech is pressured and she switches topics quickly from how she is going to be president one day to how she is going to learn 20 languages fluently by the end of the year. Upon further questioning, it is revealed that she has struggled with at least 2 depressive episodes in the past year. Her medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, and chronic migraines. She was recently diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and given nitrofurantoin. She has also been taking indomethacin for an acute gout flare. Her other medications include atorvastatin, allopurinol, metoprolol, and lithium. She is prescribed lithium and instructed to follow-up with a primary care physician. At a follow-up appointment, she complains of nausea, vomiting, and increased urinary frequency. On examination, she has a coarse tremor and diffuse hyperreflexia. Which of the following medications is most likely responsible for the patient's current presentation?

A. Indomethacin: Given the patient's recent use of indomethacin for an acute gout flare, it is likely that this medication is contributing to her current symptoms. Indomethacin can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and increased urinary frequency, which are consistent with the patient's complaints.

B. Atorvastatin: While atorvastatin is not typically associated with gastrointestinal side effects, it could potentially cause them in some individuals, particularly if taken in high doses or for extended periods. However, given the patient's other symptoms and medical history, it is less likely that atorvastatin is responsible for her current presentation.

C. Acetazolamide: Acetazolamide is a medication used to treat altitude sickness, and it is not typically associated with gastrointestinal side effects. It is unlikely to be responsible for the patient's current presentation.

D. Metoprolol: Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting, but it is less likely to cause increased urinary frequency. Given the patient's other symptoms and medical history, it is less likely that metoprolol is responsible for her current presentation."
867,"Question: A 2-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician due to increasing yellow discoloration of her eyes and skin for 2 days. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:
A. Biliary atresia
B. Physiologic neonatal jaundice
C. Isoimmune mediated hemolysis
D. Breast milk jaundice

Answer: D. Breast milk jaundice

Explanation:
The newborn's increasing yellow discoloration of her eyes and skin, along with her weight gain and exclusive breastfeeding, are all consistent with breast milk jaundice. This is a common condition in newborns who are breastfed and is caused by the bilirubin in the mother's milk. The laboratory results also support this diagnosis, as the levels of bilirubin in the newborn's blood are within the normal range for breast milk jaundice. Biliary atresia, physiologic neonatal jaundice, and isoimmune mediated hemolysis are less likely diagnoses in this case."
868,"Question: A 43-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after falling off a 10-foot ladder. He has severe pain and swelling of his right ankle and is unable to walk. He did not lose consciousness after the fall. He has no nausea. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Examination shows multiple abrasions over both lower extremities. There is swelling and tenderness of the right ankle; range of motion is limited by pain. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the ankle shows an extra-articular calcaneal fracture. Intravenous analgesia is administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?

A. MRI of the right ankle (This is not the most appropriate next step, as the patient has already undergone an x-ray of the ankle and the fracture is already evident. An MRI would not provide additional diagnostic information and would be unnecessary at this time.)

B. Long leg cast (This option is also not the most appropriate next step, as the patient has a displaced fracture of the ankle and a long leg cast would not provide adequate immobilization of the ankle. A shorter leg cast or a walking boot may be more appropriate to stabilize the ankle and allow for proper healing.)

C. Open reduction and internal fixation (This is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient, as the patient has a displaced fracture of the ankle that requires surgical intervention to properly align and stabilize the bone. Open reduction and internal fixation is a surgical procedure that involves reducing the fracture through an incision and then securing the bone with plates, screws, or rods.)

D. X-ray of the spine (This option is not relevant to the patient's presentation and is not a necessary diagnostic test. The patient has already undergone an x-ray of the ankle, which has revealed the fracture, and there is no reason to suspect any underlying spinal injury.)"
869,"Question: A 51-year-old woman presents to the physician with numbness in her legs and toes for 3 months, along with fatigue and occasional shortness of breath for the past 5 months. She is a painter. On examination, pale conjunctivae are observed, and sensation to vibration and position is absent over the lower extremities. The patient has a broad-based gait and sways when standing with her feet together and closing her eyes. Which of the following laboratory findings is most likely to be seen in this patient?

Options:
A. Poliovirus RNA in cerebrospinal fluid
B. Oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid
C. Positive rapid plasma reagin test
D. Elevated methylmalonic acid levels

Answer: D. Elevated methylmalonic acid levels.

The patient's symptoms of numbness, fatigue, and shortness of breath, along with the examination findings of pale conjunctivae, absent sensation to vibration and position over the lower extremities, and broad-based gait, are consistent with a neurological disorder. While poliovirus RNA in cerebrospinal fluid (Option A), oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid (Option B), and positive rapid plasma reagin test (Option C) are all potential diagnostic markers for certain neurological conditions, elevated methylmalonic acid levels (Option D) are more likely to be seen in a patient with a diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA), a rare neurodegenerative disorder that affects the autonomic nervous system, including the peripheral nervous system. MSA is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, and autonomic dysfunction, including peripheral neuropathy. Elevated methylmalonic acid levels are a common finding in patients with MSA, and can be used as a diagnostic marker for the disorder."
870,"Question: A 68-year-old man presents with urinary retention for the past week, which started after he was prescribed a new medication for his depression. He has tried increasing his fluid intake, but this has been ineffective. He also experiences constipation and dry mouth. What medication was most likely prescribed for his depression?

Options:
A. Phenelzine
B. Mirtazapine
C. Amitriptyline
D. Venlafaxine

Answer: C. Amitriptyline

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of urinary retention, constipation, and dry mouth are consistent with the side effects of amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant commonly used to treat depression. The other options, phenelzine, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine, are also antidepressants, but they have different side effect profiles and are less likely to cause urinary retention and other symptoms mentioned by the patient."
871,"Question: A 6-year-old boy presents to his primary care physician with severe hip pain that started this morning, stopping him from skateboarding. The patient recently recovered from an upper respiratory infection and has a past medical history of obesity. What is the best next step in management for this patient's most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Radiography - This option is incorrect as radiography is not the best next step in management for a patient with hip pain, especially in a child who has recently recovered from an upper respiratory infection. Radiography may not be able to diagnose the cause of the hip pain in this case, and it may not be necessary to evaluate the hip at this time.

B. MRI - This option is also incorrect as MRI is not the best next step in management for a patient with hip pain. MRI may not be able to diagnose the cause of the hip pain in this case, and it may not be necessary to evaluate the hip at this time.

C. Aspiration and broad spectrum antibiotics - This option is the best next step in management for this patient's most likely diagnosis. The patient's recent upper respiratory infection and past medical history of obesity increase the likelihood that the hip pain is related to an infection, such as a septic arthritis. Aspiration of the hip joint and broad spectrum antibiotics are necessary to treat the infection and prevent further complications.

D. Ibuprofen and rest - This option is incorrect as ibuprofen and rest may not be sufficient to treat the patient's hip pain, especially if the pain is severe and stopping the patient from participating in activities. The patient's recent upper respiratory infection and past medical history of obesity increase the likelihood that the hip pain is related to an infection, such as a septic arthritis, which requires prompt and appropriate treatment."
872,"Question: A 50-year-old male presents to his primary care physician for a routine check-up. He reports no bothersome symptoms and has a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension. Vital signs are within normal limits. The physician recommends a fecal occult blood test to screen for colorectal cancer. Which of the following best describes this method of disease prevention?

Options:

A. Primordial prevention - This type of prevention focuses on preventing the development of disease in individuals who have no known risk factors.
B. Primary prevention - This type of prevention focuses on preventing the development of disease in individuals who have a known risk factor, but no history of disease.
C. Secondary prevention - This type of prevention focuses on detecting and treating disease in individuals who have already developed symptoms or been diagnosed with a condition.
D. Tertiary prevention - This type of prevention focuses on managing and improving the quality of life in individuals who have already developed and been diagnosed with a chronic condition.

Answer: C. Secondary prevention - The physician is detecting and treating the patient for the presence of blood in their stool, which could be suggestive of colorectal cancer, in a secondary prevention manner."
873,"Question: A 3-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of a 2-day history of poor feeding and lethargy. He was born at term and has had three episodes of bilateral otitis media since birth. Umbilical cord separation occurred at the age of 8 weeks. He is at the 30th percentile for height and 20th percentile for weight. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F) and blood pressure is 58/36 mm Hg. Physical examination shows white oral patches and confluent scaly erythematous skin lesions in the groin. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 41,300/mm3 (92% segmented neutrophils and 8% lymphocytes) and a platelet count of 224,000/mm3. Blood cultures at 20°C (68°F) grow catalase-positive yeast cells that form pseudohyphae. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?

A. Defective beta-2 integrin
B. Defective tyrosine kinase
C. Defective microtubules
D. Defective actin cytoskeleton

Answer: A. Defective beta-2 integrin

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of poor feeding and lethargy, along with the presence of white oral patches and confluent scaly erythematous skin lesions in the groin, are consistent with a diagnosis of candidiasis. Candidiasis is caused by an overgrowth of Candida albicans, a fungus that normally lives on the skin and mucous membranes. The presence of catalase-positive yeast cells that form pseudohyphae in the blood cultures further supports this diagnosis.

Defective beta-2 integrin is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Beta-2 integrin is a cell surface receptor that plays a crucial role in the immune response to Candida albicans. Mutations in the gene encoding beta-2 integrin can lead to impaired adhesion of neutrophils to the fungal cell wall, which can impair the immune response to Candida albicans and lead to candidiasis.

Option A is the correct answer."
874,"Question:

A 5-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother due to poor weight gain and chronic diarrhea. He has had 3 episodes of otitis media since birth. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated, but his mother received no prenatal care. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 10th percentile for height and 5th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows thick white plaques on the surface of his tongue that can be easily scraped off with a tongue blade. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?

Options:

A. Fluconazole
B. Pencillin G
C. Zidovudine
D. Rifampin

Answer: C. Zidovudine.

Zidovudine is an antiretroviral drug that is commonly used to prevent and treat HIV infection in newborns. The thick white plaques on the surface of the patient's tongue are a common manifestation of HIV infection, and Zidovudine would have been most effective in preventing the patient's condition if he had been exposed to HIV in utero or during delivery. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that is not effective in preventing HIV infection, while Pencillin G is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that may be effective in treating bacterial infections but would not have prevented the patient's HIV infection. Rifampin is an antibiotic that is effective against tuberculosis but would not have prevented the patient's HIV infection."
875,"Question:

Biopsy results confirm a diagnosis of pleomorphic lobular carcinoma-in-situ that is estrogen receptor-positive. The patient undergoes lumpectomy and initiates treatment with tamoxifen. Which of the following is most likely to occur as a result of tamoxifen therapy?

Options:
A. Endometrial cancer - Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, can increase the risk of endometrial cancer in some patients.
B. Osteoporosis - Tamoxifen can cause bone loss and increase the risk of osteoporosis in some patients, particularly those who are postmenopausal.
C. Myelosuppression - Tamoxifen can cause a decrease in white blood cell count, red blood cell count, or platelet count in some patients.
D. Ovarian cancer - There is no evidence to suggest that tamoxifen increases the risk of ovarian cancer.

Answer: A. Endometrial cancer"
877,"Sure! Here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: Laboratory tests reveal that a patient's hematocrit is 32%, their white blood cell count is 9,400/mm3, and their platelet count is 96,000/mm3. Additionally, serum tests show an aspartate aminotransferase level of 94 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase level of 92 U/L. Based on these results, which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient's condition?

Options:

A. The patient's coagulation pathway is overactive.
B. The patient is experiencing viral reactivation and replication.

878,"Question: A 57-year-old man presents to the emergency department after an episode of syncope. He experiences sudden weakness and persistent back pain, followed by forceful vomiting. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and depression. He smokes 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day and drinks 10 alcoholic beverages each night. His temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 107/48 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. A chest radiograph is within normal limits. Physical exam reveals abdominal tenderness and the patient is resting in an antalgic position. Urinalysis is pending but shows a concentrated urine sample. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Abdominal aortic aneurysm: The patient's symptoms of syncope, back pain, and vomiting, along with his history of hypertension and smoking, suggest a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm. An aneurysm in the abdominal aorta can cause sudden weakness, back pain, and vomiting, and can lead to life-threatening complications if ruptured.

B. Boerhaave syndrome: This condition is characterized by the rupture of the esophagus, which can occur due to vomiting and can lead to respiratory failure. While the patient's symptoms of syncope and back pain are consistent with Boerhaave syndrome, the presence of a concentrated urine sample on urinalysis suggests that this diagnosis is less likely.

C. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's symptoms of back pain and vomiting, along with the presence of a concentrated urine sample, suggest the possibility of nephrolithiasis. However, this diagnosis is less likely given the patient's history of diabetes, hypertension, and smoking, which can increase the risk of complications.

D. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms of back pain and vomiting, along with his history of alcohol consumption, suggest the possibility of pancreatitis. However, the patient's recent episode of syncope and the presence of a concentrated urine sample suggest that this diagnosis is less likely.

Answer: A. Abdominal aortic aneurysm"
879,"Question: A 57-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting for 4 days. Her vital signs are: temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse 100/min, respirations 20/min, blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows: pH 7.58, PCO2 43 mm Hg, PO2 96 mm Hg, HCO3- 32 mEq/L. What is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

A. Urine albumin to creatinine ratio
B. Serum osmolal gap
C. Urine chloride
D. Serum anion gap

Answer: C. Urine chloride.

Rationale: The arterial blood gas analysis shows a normal pH and normal partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), but a low partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) and a high anion gap. The high anion gap suggests that there may be excessive loss of anions in the urine, which could be due to a variety of causes such as diabetic ketoacidosis, metabolic acidosis, or kidney disease. Measuring the urine chloride concentration can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management."
880,"Question: An 11-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician by his mother after he has complained of worsening left thumb pain for the last two weeks. The mother reports that the patient was previously healthy. Approximately 2 weeks ago, the family cat bit the patient’s thumb. The area around the bite wound then became red, hot, and slightly swollen and never healed. Earlier this week, the patient also started developing fevers that were recorded at home to be as high as 103.6°F. On exam, the patient's temperature is 102.2°F (39.0°C), blood pressure is 112/72 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 14/min. The patient’s left thumb is tender to touch over the proximal phalanx and the interphalangeal joint, but there is no obvious erythema or swelling. A radiograph performed in clinic is concerning for osteomyelitis at the proximal phalanx. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?

A. Bartonella henselae - This bacteria is commonly found in cat scratches and bites, and can cause osteomyelitis, particularly in children.

B. Pasteurella multocida - This bacteria is commonly found in cat bites and scratches, and can cause osteomyelitis and cellulitis.

C. Pseudomonas aeruginosa - This bacteria can cause osteomyelitis and other infections, but is less likely to be the cause of this patient's condition given the history of a cat bite and the presence of osteomyelitis on radiograph.

D. Salmonella spp. - This bacteria can cause a variety of infections, including osteomyelitis, but is less likely to be the cause of this patient's condition given the history of a cat bite and the presence of osteomyelitis on radiograph.

Answer: B. Pasteurella multocida"

He was not wearing a seatbelt and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9, indicating inappropriate responses to questions. His vital signs are: temperature, 96.0°F (35.6°C); blood pressure, 64/44 mmHg; pulse, 192/min; respirations, 32/min; and oxygen saturation, 94% on room air. Which of the following interventions is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's hypotension?

Options:

A. Dobutamine: This medication is a vasopressor that can increase blood pressure in patients with hypotension. However, it may not be the best choice for this patient given their GCS score, as they may have a high likelihood of cerebral injury and increased intracranial pressure.

B. Norepinephrine: This medication is another vasopressor that can increase blood pressure in patients with hypotension. It may be a better choice than dobutamine for this patient due to their GCS score, as it can help improve perfusion to the brain and other vital organs.

C. Normal saline: Administration of normal saline may help to hydrate the patient and improve blood volume, which can help to improve blood pressure. However, this intervention may not be enough to significantly improve hypotension in this patient.

D. Whole blood: This intervention may be appropriate if the patient is bleeding significantly and has a low hemoglobin level. However, in this scenario, the patient's vital signs suggest that they are not bleeding significantly, and whole blood may not be the most appropriate intervention.

Answer: D. Whole blood."

He reports no other symptoms and denies any weight loss or tingling in his extremities. His medical history includes poorly controlled hypertension and a previous back surgery. He drinks socially and has smoked 1 pack per day since he was 20. His family history is significant for cancer, and he is concerned that his father had similar symptoms before being diagnosed with multiple myeloma. On physical exam, a painful, pulsatile enlargement is noted in the patient's abdomen. Which of the following locations has the highest risk of developing this patient's disorder?

A. Diaphragm and renal arteries
B. Diaphragm and superior mesenteric artery
C. Renal arteries and common iliac arteries
D. Superior mesenteric artery and common iliac arteries

Answer: C. Renal arteries and common iliac arteries.

The patient's symptoms of flank and back pain, along with the physical examination finding of a painful, pulsatile enlargement in the abdomen, are consistent with a possible diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The aorta and its branches, including the renal arteries and common iliac arteries, are at the highest risk of developing an aneurysm. Therefore, option C is the correct answer."
883,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 21-year-old woman visits her primary care physician for a routine check-up. She is concerned about a recent needle-stick injury while volunteering at a public park. Additionally, she reveals that she consumed approximately 8 drinks last night to celebrate her best friend's engagement. Her physical examination reveals scleral icterus and mild jaundice. Lab results are as follows:

ALT: 9 U/L (normal range: 8-20 U/L)
AST: 11 U/L (normal range: 8-20 U/L)
Total bilirubin: 3.5 mg/dL (normal range: 0.1-1.0 mg/dL)
Direct bilirubin: 0.2 mg/dL (normal range: 0.0-0.3 mg/dL)
Hematocrit: 41% (normal range: 36%-46%)

Which of the following processes is most likely responsible for this patient's jaundice?

A. The patient's jaundice is likely caused by defective conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid.
B. The patient's jaundice is more likely due to defective secretion of bilirubin into the bile duct.
C. The patient's jaundice may be caused by excessive extravascular hemolysis.
D. The patient's jaundice is likely a result of a viral infection of hepatocytes.

Answer: A. Defective conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid."

An ultrasound is also done to the patient, which is shown in the picture. What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Liver abscess
B. Hepatitis B
C. Acute cholecystitis
D. Cholangitis

Answer: A. Liver abscess

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss, along with the laboratory results showing elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, are highly suggestive of a liver abscess. The ultrasound image also supports this diagnosis, showing a well-defined hypoechoic lesion in the liver with a distinct capsule. Hepatitis B and acute cholecystitis are less likely diagnoses given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Cholangitis is also less likely, as the patient does not have a history of biliary disease or jaundice."
885,"Question: An investigator for a nationally representative health survey is evaluating the heights and weights of men and women aged 18-74 years in the United States. The investigator finds that for each sex, the distribution of heights is well-fitted by a normal distribution. The distribution of weight is not normally distributed. Results are shown:

Mean Standard deviation
Height (inches), men 69 0.1
Height (inches), women 64 0.1
Weight (pounds), men 182 1.0
Weight (pounds), women 154 1.0

Based on these results, which of the following statements is most likely to be correct?

A. 68% of weights in women are likely to fall between 153 and 155 pounds.
B. 99.7% of heights in women are likely to fall between 63.7 and 64.3 inches.
C. 99.7% of heights in men are likely to fall between 68.8 and 69.2 inches.
D. 95% of heights in men are likely to fall between 68.85 and 69.15 inches.

Answer: B. 99.7% of heights in women are likely to fall between 63.7 and 64.3 inches.

Explanation:

The investigator found that the distribution of heights for both men and women follows a normal distribution, which means that the heights are evenly distributed around the mean height of 69 inches for men and 64 inches for women.

However, the distribution of weights for women is not normally distributed, which suggests that the weights are not evenly distributed around the mean weight of 154 pounds. Instead, the weights are more likely to be concentrated at the lower end of the range, with only a small percentage of weights falling between 153 and 155 pounds (68% of weights in women).

Therefore, option B is the most likely to be correct, as it describes the distribution of heights in women most accurately."

887,"Question: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department with back pain that has been steadily worsening over the past month. The patient rates his current pain as a 7/10 and feels short of breath. Which of the following is the best initial step in management of this patient?

Options:
A. Radiography of the lumbosacral spine - This is the best initial step in management of this patient as the patient's symptoms of back pain and shortness of breath could be indicative of a serious underlying condition such as a spinal fracture or infection, which can be diagnosed through radiography.

B. MRI of the sacroiliac joint - While MRI can provide detailed images of the sacroiliac joint, it may not be the most appropriate initial imaging modality for this patient as the patient's symptoms are more suggestive of a spinal issue.

C. CT scan of the chest - A CT scan of the chest may be useful in evaluating the patient's respiratory symptoms, but it is unlikely to provide diagnostic information about the patient's back pain.

D. Ultrasound - Ultrasound is not a suitable initial imaging modality for this patient as it cannot provide detailed images of the spine or detect underlying conditions such as infection or fracture.

Answer: A. Radiography of the lumbosacral spine."
888,"Question: A 29-year-old man from India presents at a clinic with complaints of sore muscles and lethargy lasting several days. After physical examination and laboratory testing, the patient is advised to stay for treatment and monitoring. However, the patient leaves the hospital against medical advice. He subsequently experiences difficulty breathing and anuria, and is brought to the emergency department in a loss of consciousness. An immediate T2 weighted image of the patient's head is obtained, which shows abnormalities in the brain. What is the best course of treatment for the patient's condition?

A. Atovaquone-proguanil: This medication is effective in treating malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that is most likely to cause the patient's symptoms. It is important to start treatment as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms to prevent the disease from progressing and causing further damage to the brain and other organs.

B. Primaquine: This medication is also effective in treating malaria, particularly against the Plasmodium vivax parasite. However, it is not as effective as Atovaquone-proguanil in treating P. falciparum malaria, and is typically reserved for patients who have a history of malaria recurrence.

C. Chloroquine: This medication is an older anti-malarial drug that is less effective than Atovaquone-proguanil and Primaquine in treating malaria. It is no longer recommended for the treatment of malaria in most cases, as it is less effective against the strains of the parasite that are most common in many parts of the world.

D. Chloramphenicol: This medication is an antibiotic that is unrelated to anti-malarial drugs. It is not effective in treating malaria and should not be used as a substitute for the recommended anti-malarial medication.

Answer: A. Atovaquone-proguanil."
889,"Sure! Here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 21-year-old pregnant woman visits her physician at 39 weeks of gestation, feeling generally well but with some mild swelling and fatigue.

890,"Question: A 35-year-old man with a past medical history of HIV is hospitalized with a disseminated zoster infection and treated with IV acyclovir. His course of illness worsens on the 4th day after admission and his creatinine level increases to 4.2 mg/dL. Urinalysis shows birefringent needle-shaped crystals. What could have prevented this deterioration in the patient's renal function?

Options:

A. Initial administration of glucocorticoids - This option is incorrect because glucocorticoids can actually worsen renal function in patients with HIV infection, particularly when used in high doses or for extended periods.

B. Obtaining a thorough history of patient allergies - While a thorough history of allergies is important for any patient, it would not have prevented the deterioration in the patient's renal function in this scenario.

C. Adequate initial hydration - This is the correct answer. Adequate hydration is essential in patients with HIV infection, particularly when they are hospitalized and receiving medications that can cause renal impairment. Dehydration can worsen renal function and increase the risk of acute kidney injury.

D. Initial administration of allopurinol - This option is incorrect because allopurinol is not a treatment for zoster infection and would not have prevented the deterioration in the patient's renal function.

Answer: C. Adequate initial hydration"
891,"Question: A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department for a sudden loss of vision in his right eye. He was gardening when he lost vision, and it resolved by the time he arrived at the hospital. He feels fine, but has a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension. His medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, metformin, and insulin. His vital signs are normal, except for a mild systolic murmur heard on cardiac exam. His neurological exam is grossly intact, but he has a negative Romberg's maneuver. A CT scan of the head shows mild cerebral atrophy. Which of the following is the next best step in management?

A. Tissue plasminogen activator
B. MRI
C. Heparin bridge to warfarin
D. Ultrasound of the neck

Answer: D. Ultrasound of the neck

Rationale: The patient's sudden loss of vision in his right eye, along with his normal vital signs and grossly intact neurological exam, suggest that the cause of his vision loss may be related to a vascular event, such as a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). An ultrasound of the neck can help identify any underlying vascular abnormalities, such as an carotid artery stenosis, that may be causing the vision loss. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is not appropriate in this scenario, as it is only used for acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. MRI is not necessary in this case, as the CT scan of the head showed no acute abnormalities. Heparin bridge to warfarin is not a appropriate management option for this patient, as it is used for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, and the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes do not meet the criteria for this indication."
892,"Question: A 26-year-old primigravid woman at 25 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She has no history of serious illness and her only medication is a daily prenatal vitamin. A 1-hour 50-g glucose challenge shows a glucose concentration of 167 mg/dL (N < 135). A 100-g oral glucose tolerance test shows glucose concentrations of 213 mg/dL (N < 180) and 165 mg/dL (N < 140) at 1 and 3 hours, respectively. If she does not receive adequate treatment for her condition, which of the following complications is her infant at greatest risk of developing?

Options:
A. Islet cell hyperplasia: The pancreatic beta cells of the fetus are at risk of excessive proliferation (islet cell hyperplasia) in the absence of adequate glucose supply, leading to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus in the offspring.
B. Decreased amniotic fluid production: Prolonged hyperglycemia can cause a decrease in amniotic fluid production, which can lead to fetal dehydration and increased risk of umbilical cord compression.
C. Omphalocele: Prolonged hyperglycemia can cause increased pressure on the umbilical cord, leading to a higher risk of omphalocele, a birth defect in which the intestine and other organs protrude through the umbilical ring.
D. Decreased hematocrit: Prolonged hyperglycemia can cause anemia, leading to a decrease in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels in the fetus.

Answer: A. Islet cell hyperplasia."
893,"Question: A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to the sudden onset of severe substernal chest pain at rest, along with diaphoresis and anxiety. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and alcohol use disorder. An ECG shows ST-segment elevations in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6. One hour later, he develops dyspnea and a productive cough with frothy sputum. Which of the following best describes the most likely underlying pathophysiology of this patient's dyspnea?

Options:

A. Transudation of plasma into the alveoli: This is the most likely underlying pathophysiology of the patient's dyspnea. The sudden onset of chest pain and the development of dyspnea and cough with frothy sputum suggest that there is an inflammatory response in the lungs, which can lead to fluid accumulation in the alveoli. This can cause difficulty breathing and shortness of breath.

B. Localized constriction of the pulmonary vasculature: While this option is possible, it is less likely to be the primary cause of the patient's dyspnea. Constriction of the pulmonary vasculature can lead to decreased blood flow to the lungs, which can worsen dyspnea, but it is unlikely to cause the sudden onset of symptoms seen in this case.

C. Bacterial infiltration into the pulmonary parenchyma: This option is also possible, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and the ECG findings. The patient's history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and alcohol use disorder may increase the risk of respiratory infections, but the sudden onset of symptoms and the ECG changes suggest a more acute process.

D. Increased permeability of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells: This option is not supported by the patient's symptoms and the ECG findings. Increased permeability of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells can lead to fluid leakage into the alveoli, but it is unlikely to cause the sudden onset of chest pain and dyspnea seen in this case.

Answer: A. Transudation of plasma into the alveoli."
894,"Question: A 56-year-old male presents with feelings of anxiety and fatigue for the past 4 months, along with weight loss, double vision, gritty sensation in his eyes, painless swelling in his fingers and lower legs, and denies any recent history of fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea, or vomiting. What is the likely mechanism responsible for this patient's condition?

Options:

A. Autoantibodies resulting in tissue destruction
B. Autoantibody stimulation of a receptor
C. Excessive exogenous hormone use
D. Infiltration of tissue by neoplastic cells

Answer: B. Autoantibody stimulation of a receptor

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of anxiety, fatigue, weight loss, double vision, gritty sensation in the eyes, and painless swelling in the fingers and lower legs are consistent with an autoimmune disorder, where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues. Autoantibody stimulation of a receptor is a common mechanism underlying autoimmune disorders, and it is likely that the patient's symptoms are caused by the immune system producing antibodies that stimulate a receptor on affected tissues, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. The other options are less likely mechanisms for this patient's condition."
895,"Question: A 25-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with recurrent headaches, concerns about his cancer risk, sexual performance, and relationship with his family. Based on his symptoms and medical history, which of the following is the best initial step in management?

Options:
A. Buspirone - This medication is commonly used to treat anxiety disorders, but it may not be the best option for this patient given his concerns about cancer risk and relationship issues.
B. Clonazepam - This medication is also used to treat anxiety disorders, but it may not address the patient's concerns about cancer risk and relationship issues.
C. Fluoxetine - This medication is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. It may help the patient manage his anxiety and improve his mood, which could potentially improve his relationship with his family and address his concerns about cancer risk.
D. Sumatriptan - This medication is used to treat migraines, but it may not be effective in managing the patient's anxiety or relationship issues.

Answer: C. Fluoxetine."
896,"Question: A 30-year-old man presents with dark urine and fatigue. He has recently developed yellowing of the eyes and reports that these symptoms started two days ago. He was diagnosed with acute otitis media three days ago and was prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. He does not take any other medications on a daily basis and was adopted without any knowledge of his family history. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 100/75 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. On physical examination, he is alert and cooperative, with a cardiac exam that reveals an early systolic murmur at the 2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line, and scleral icterus. The peripheral blood smear shows the presence of bite cells and Heinz bodies. Which of the following laboratory findings would most likely be present in this patient?

A) Decreased reticulocyte count: This is unlikely, as the patient's peripheral blood smear shows the presence of bite cells and Heinz bodies, which are indicative of hemolytic anemia. A decreased reticulocyte count would not be consistent with this diagnosis.

B) Decreased indirect bilirubin levels: This is also unlikely, as the patient's scleral icterus suggests that there is a significant amount of bilirubin in the bloodstream. Decreased indirect bilirubin levels would not be consistent with this clinical presentation.

C) Increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): This is the most likely laboratory finding in this patient. LDH is an enzyme that is released from damaged red blood cells, and the patient's peripheral blood smear shows the presence of bite cells and Heinz bodies, which are indicative of hemolytic anemia. An increase in LDH levels would be consistent with this diagnosis.

D) Decreased mean corpuscular volume: This is also unlikely, as there is no mention of any abnormalities in the patient's mean corpuscular volume on the peripheral blood smear.

Therefore, the answer is C) Increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)."
897,"Question: A 19-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of blurry vision, headaches, facial pain, and increased urination. She also reports a black spot on her face that has been growing in size over the past month. The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and has recently lost weight. What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?

Options:

A. Bacillus anthracis - This bacterium can cause a range of symptoms including fever, headache, and skin lesions, but it is not likely to cause blurry vision or facial pain.

B. Mucormycosis - This is a rare but potentially life-threatening fungal infection that can cause facial pain, headaches, and blurry vision. The patient's history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and recent weight loss increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.

C. Aspergillus fumigatus - This fungus can cause a range of symptoms including cough, fever, and chest pain, but it is not typically associated with blurry vision or facial pain.

D. Clostridium difficile - This bacterium can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, but it is not likely to cause blurry vision or facial pain.

Answer: B. Mucormycosis."
898,"Question: A 45-year-old woman is advised to undergo a contrast-CT scan of the abdomen due to suspected colon cancer. She has no comorbidities and no significant past medical history, but reports seafood allergy. After the scan, she develops itching, rashes, and difficulty breathing. What is the most appropriate management of this patient?

Options:

A. Perform IV resuscitation with colloids - Incorrect. Colloids may not be the most appropriate choice of fluid for this patient, as they may worsen the allergic reaction.

B. Administer broad-spectrum IV antibiotics - Incorrect. While an allergic reaction may have caused the patient's symptoms, antibiotics are not the appropriate treatment for this condition.

C. Administer vasopressors (norepinephrine and dopamine) - Incorrect. Vasopressors may not be effective in managing the patient's symptoms, as they are not related to hypotension.

D. Inject epinephrine 1:1000, followed by steroids and antihistamines - Correct. Epinephrine is the most appropriate medication to administer in this situation, as it can help to counteract the effects of the allergic reaction. Steroids and antihistamines may also be beneficial in managing the patient's symptoms."
899,"Question: An 8-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of a 6-month history of an episodic dry cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. She has seasonal allergic rhinitis. Physical examination shows high-pitched expiratory wheezes throughout both lung fields. Pulmonary function testing shows an FEV1 of 70% (N ≥ 80%). Which of the following drugs would be most effective at reducing bronchial inflammation in this patient?

Options:

A. Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a long-acting beta-2 agonist that can help reduce bronchial inflammation by relaxing the smooth muscle in the airways and increasing lung function. However, it may not be as effective in reducing inflammation as other options.

B. Adenosine: Adenosine is an anti-inflammatory drug that can help reduce bronchial inflammation by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators from airway cells. It may be effective in reducing inflammation in this patient, but it may also have side effects such as sedation and hypotension.

C. Tiotropium: Tiotropium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist that can help reduce bronchial inflammation by blocking the action of acetylcholine on airway smooth muscle. It can also help improve lung function and reduce symptoms such as coughing.

D. Budesonide: Budesonide is a corticosteroid that can help reduce bronchial inflammation by suppressing the production of inflammatory mediators in the airways. It is a potent anti-inflammatory drug that can be effective in reducing inflammation in this patient, but it may also have side effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression.

Answer: D. Budesonide. Budesonide is the most effective drug for reducing bronchial inflammation in this patient, given its potent anti-inflammatory effects and ability to suppress the production of inflammatory mediators in the airways."
900,"Question: A 32-year-old woman seeks medical advice for genetic counseling. She has a history of recurring generalized seizures, diffuse muscle weakness, and multiple episodes of transient left-sided paresis. She has been hospitalized several times for severe lactic acidosis requiring intravenous fluid hydration. Her 10-year-old daughter also experiences seizures and muscle weakness, while her 7-year-old son has occasional muscle weakness and headaches but has never had a seizure. A biopsy specimen from the woman's soleus muscle showed ragged-appearing muscle fibers. Genetic analysis of the patient's son is most likely to reveal:

A. Silenced paternal gene copy
B. Heterogeneous mitochondrial DNA
C. Mutation in a DNA repair gene
D. Genetically distinct cell lines

Answer: B. Heterogeneous mitochondrial DNA

Explanation: The patient's history of recurring generalized seizures, diffuse muscle weakness, and multiple episodes of transient left-sided paresis, as well as the presence of ragged-appearing muscle fibers in a biopsy specimen from her soleus muscle, suggest an inherited muscle disorder. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are a common cause of inherited muscle disorders, and the presence of heterogeneous mtDNA in the patient's son suggests that he may also have a mtDNA mutation that is causing or contributing to his symptoms. Silenced paternal gene copy (option A), mutation in a DNA repair gene (option C), and genetically distinct cell lines (option D) are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms based on the information provided."

Physical examination reveals diaphoresis and a fine tremor of the outstretched hands. The thyroid gland is enlarged, firm, and tender to palpation. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone level is 0.06 μU/mL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 65 mm/h. 123I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with diffusely decreased uptake. Histopathological examination of a thyroid biopsy specimen is most likely to reveal which of the following features?

A. Follicular epithelial cell hyperplasia: This condition is characterized by an increase in the number of follicular epithelial cells in the thyroid gland, often resulting in a non-cancerous nodule.
B. Concentric intracellular lamellar calcifications: This is a rare finding in which calcifications are present within the follicular cells of the thyroid gland, often associated with other conditions such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease.
C. Lymphocytic infiltration with germinal follicle formation: This condition is characterized by the infiltration of lymphocytes into the thyroid gland, leading to the formation of germinal follicles.
D. Noncaseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells: This condition is characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas, which are collections of immune cells that do not form a hard, compact capsule around the affected tissue, and the presence of multinucleated giant cells, which are large cells formed by the fusion of multiple immune cells.

905,"Question: A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician due to a 2-week history of frequent episodes of unresponsiveness. During these episodes, he stares blankly, rhythmically nods his head, and does not respond to verbal stimulation for several seconds. Hyperventilation for 30 seconds precipitates an episode of unresponsiveness and head nodding that lasts for 7 seconds. He regains consciousness immediately afterward. An electroencephalogram shows 3-Hz spikes and waves. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?

Options:

A. Increased frequency of GABAA channel opening
B. Blockade of thalamic T-type calcium channels
C. Increased duration of GABAA channel opening
D. Inhibition of GABA reuptake into presynaptic neurons

Answer: B. Blockade of thalamic T-type calcium channels

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of unresponsiveness, rhythmic head nodding, and brief episodes of unresponsiveness after hyperventilation are consistent with a diagnosis of absence seizures. The 3-Hz spikes and waves observed on the electroencephalogram (EEG) are also typical of absence seizures. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be a drug that blocks the action of T-type calcium channels in the thalamus, which are involved in the genesis of absence seizures.

Blockade of thalamic T-type calcium channels can help to reduce the frequency and severity of absence seizures by decreasing the excitability of the thalamus and the spread of seizure activity to other parts of the brain. This is supported by studies showing that drugs that block T-type calcium channels, such as gabapentin, can reduce the frequency and severity of absence seizures in patients with epilepsy.

In contrast, options A, C, and D are not supported by the patient's symptoms and EEG findings. Increased frequency of GABAA channel opening (option A) would not be expected to reduce the frequency and severity of absence seizures, as GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that can actually increase the excitability of the brain during seizures. Increased duration of GABAA channel opening (option C) would also not be expected to have a significant effect on absence seizures. Inhibition of GABA reuptake into presynaptic neurons (option D) is also not directly related to the mechanism of action of drugs that block T-type calcium channels in the thalamus."
906,"Question: A 4-week-old male presents to the pediatrician for a well-child visit with a history of vomiting after breastfeeding. What is the best next step in management?

Options:

A. Abdominal ultrasound - This imaging study can help identify any structural abnormalities in the abdomen that may be contributing to the vomiting.

B. Abdominal radiograph - A chest X-ray can help evaluate for any signs of aspiration or other abdominal conditions that may be causing the vomiting.

C. Trial of cow's milk-free diet - If the vomiting is caused by a sensitivity or allergy to cow's milk, a trial of a cow's milk-free diet may help resolve the issue.

D. Trial of empiric proton pump inhibitor - Proton pump inhibitors can help reduce the acidity of the stomach, which may help alleviate vomiting in some cases.

Question: A 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. Her first pregnancy and delivery were complicated by iron deficiency anemia and pregnancy-induced hypertension. She has had no routine prenatal care during this pregnancy but was diagnosed with oligohydramnios 4 weeks ago. The remainder of her medical history is not immediately available. A 2400-g (5.4-lb) female newborn is delivered vaginally. Examination of the newborn shows a short, mildly webbed neck and low-set ears. Ocular hypertelorism along with slanted palpebral fissures are noted. A cleft palate and hypoplasia of the nails and distal phalanges are present. There is increased coarse hair on the body and face. Which of the following best explains the clinical findings found in this newborn?

Options:
A. Maternal phenytoin therapy: The newborn's clinical findings are consistent with exposure to phenytoin during pregnancy, which can cause craniofacial abnormalities such as a short, mildly webbed neck and low-set ears.
B. Fetal posterior urethral valves: The newborn's cleft palate and hypoplasia of the nails and distal phalanges are consistent with fetal posterior urethral valves, which are a congenital anomaly that can occur alone or in combination with other genetic syndromes.
C. Maternal diabetes mellitus: While the newborn's clinical findings could be related to maternal diabetes mellitus, the absence of other typical findings such as macrosomia or polyhydramnios makes this less likely.
D. Maternal alcohol intake: There is no evidence to suggest that the newborn's clinical findings are related to maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy."

The patient’s father says he is unable to track with his eyes and is unresponsive to verbal stimuli. The patient is hypotonic on physical exam. Further studies show elevated serum lactate levels and elevated levels of alanine and pyruvate. Family history reveals that several distant family members suffered from neurological diseases and died of unknown causes at a young age. Which of the following amino acids should be increased in this patient’s diet?

Options:

A. Methionine - Methionine is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or medical history, and is not likely to be helpful in addressing their condition.

B. Isoleucine - Isoleucine is not a direct cause of the patient's symptoms or medical history, and is also not likely to be helpful in addressing their condition.

C. Arginine - Arginine is an amino acid that has been shown to have potential benefits for neurological function and development, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or medical history. Increasing arginine in the patient's diet may be helpful, but more research is needed to confirm this.

D. Leucine - Leucine is an amino acid that has been shown to have potential benefits for neurological function and development, and is directly related to the patient's symptoms and medical history. Increasing leucine in the patient's diet may be helpful in addressing their condition.

910,"Question: A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he is found sluggish, drowsy, feverish, and complaining about a headache. His past medical history is unremarkable. His vital signs include: blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg, heart rate 70/min, respiratory rate 17/min, and body temperature 39.0°C (102.2°F). On physical examination, the patient is dysphasic and incapable of following commands. Gait ataxia is present. No meningeal signs or photophobia are present. A noncontrast CT of the head is unremarkable. A T2 MRI is performed and is shown in the image. A lumbar puncture (LP) is subsequently performed. Which of the following CSF findings would you most likely expect to find in this patient?

A. Opening pressure: 28 cm H2O, color: cloudy, protein: 68 mg/dL, cell count: 150 cells/µL, mostly PMNs, ratio CSF:blood glucose: 0.3
B. Opening pressure: 40 cm H2O, color: cloudy, protein: 80 mg/dL, cell count: 135 cells/µL, mostly lymphocytes with some PMNs, ratio CSF:blood glucose: 0.2
C. Opening pressure: 15 cm H2O, color: clear, protein: 50 mg/dL, cell count: 40 cells/µL, mostly lymphocytes, ratio CSF:blood glucose: 0.65
D. Opening pressure: 38 cm H2O, color: cloudy, protein: 75 mg/dL, cell count: 80 cells/µL, mostly lymphocytes, ratio CSF:blood glucose: 0.25

Answer: C. Opening pressure: 15 cm H2O, color: clear, protein: 50 mg/dL, cell count: 40 cells/µL, mostly lymphocytes, ratio CSF:blood glucose: 0.65.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms and signs, including dysphasia, gait ataxia, and a normal noncontrast CT of the head, are consistent with a diagnosis of meningitis. The T2 MRI image shows a high signal intensity in the frontal lobe, which is consistent with inflammation in the meninges. The low opening pressure and normal protein and cell count in the CSF suggest that the meningitis is likely caused by a viral infection, rather than a bacterial infection. The ratio of CSF glucose to blood glucose is also normal, which is consistent with a viral etiology. Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, it is most likely that the patient has a viral meningitis."
911,"Question: A 61-year-old man presents to the physician with a 2-month history of a productive cough with clear mucoid sputum. He has a 33-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities, and a chest X-ray shows a 2-cm solid nodule in the periphery of the lower left lobe. A bronchial biopsy of the mass shows numerous mucin-filled epithelial cells lining the alveolar basement membrane, with prominent nucleoli, coarse chromatin, and some cells having multiple nuclei. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Small cell carcinoma (A. :This type of cancer is characterized by a highly aggressive growth pattern and rapid proliferation, which is not consistent with the slow growth rate and benign nature of adenocarcinoma in situ.)
B. Pulmonary hamartoma (B. :This is a rare benign tumor that arises from the embryonic remnants of the lung, but it is not typically associated with smoking or a productive cough.)
C. Adenocarcinoma in situ (C. :This type of cancer is a precancerous lesion that arises in the epithelial cells lining the air sacs of the lung, and it is characterized by the presence of numerous mucin-filled cells with prominent nucleoli, coarse chromatin, and multiple nuclei, which are similar to the findings in the bronchial biopsy.)
D. Carcinoid tumor (D. :This type of cancer is a slow-growing, well-differentiated neoplasm that typically arises in the bronchi or bronchioles of the lung, but it is not characterized by the presence of mucin-filled cells or a productive cough.)

912,"Question: A 24-year-old primigravida presents to her physician for regular prenatal care at 31 weeks gestation. She has no complaints, and the antepartum course has been uncomplicated. Her pre-gestational history is significant for obesity (BMI = 30.5 kg/m2). She has gained a total of 10 kg (22.4 lb) during pregnancy and 2 kg (4.48 lb) since her last visit 4 weeks ago. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 145/90 mm Hg; heart rate, 87/min; respiratory rate, 14/min; and temperature, 36.7°C (98°F). The fetal heart rate is 153/min. The physical examination shows no edema and is only significant for a 2/6 systolic murmur best heard at the apex of the heart. A 24-hour urine is negative for protein. Which of the following options best describes the management strategy in this case?

Options:

A. Admission to the hospital for observation
B. Treatment in outpatient settings with labetalol
C. Observation in the outpatient settings
D. Treatment in outpatient settings with nifedipine

Answer: C. Observation in the outpatient settings.

Rationale: Based on the patient's vital signs and physical examination findings, there are no signs of pregnancy-related complications that require hospitalization. The patient's BMI is within the normal range, and there is no proteinuria detected in the 24-hour urine protein test. As the patient is not experiencing any symptoms of preeclampsia, such as severe headache, visual disturbances, or abdominal pain, observation in the outpatient settings is the most appropriate management strategy. Labetalol and nifedipine are medications used to treat preeclampsia, but they are typically prescribed in outpatient settings after a diagnosis has been confirmed."
913,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for the evaluation of a skin rash that has been present for just one day. The patient reports intense itching. He was born at 39 weeks' gestation and has a history of atopic dermatitis. He attends junior high school and went on a camping trip with his school the day before yesterday. His older brother has celiac disease. Examination shows erythematous papules and vesicles arranged in a linear pattern on the right forearm. Laboratory studies are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?

Options:

A. IgG antibodies against hemidesmosomes
B. Preformed IgE antibodies
C. Immune complex formation
D. Presensitized T cells

Answer: D. Presensitized T cells

Explanation:
The patient's history of atopic dermatitis and the presence of erythematous papules and vesicles on the right forearm suggest an allergic reaction. The fact that the patient's older brother has celiac disease also supports this diagnosis. Presensitized T cells are most likely to be involved in the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, as they play a key role in the allergic response. IgG antibodies against hemidesmosomes, preformed IgE antibodies, and immune complex formation are less likely to be involved in this patient's condition."

A. Amitriptyline: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that has been shown to be effective in treating depression in patients with a history of erectile dysfunction. However, it may have a longer onset of action compared to other antidepressants, which may not be suitable for a patient who is experiencing immediate symptoms of depression.

B. Bupropion: Bupropion is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI) that has been shown to be effective in treating depression without causing erectile dysfunction. It has a relatively mild side effect profile and may be a good option for a patient who has experienced negative side effects with other medications.

C. Citalopram: Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been shown to be effective in treating depression. However, it may take several weeks to reach its full therapeutic effect, which may not be suitable for a patient who is experiencing immediate symptoms of depression.

D. Mirtazapine: Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic antidepressant that has been shown to be effective in treating depression. However, it can cause weight gain and sedation, which may be a concern for a patient with a BMI of 29 kg/m^2.

Answer: B. Bupropion. Bupropion is a good option for this patient due to its mild side effect profile and ability to treat depression without causing erectile dysfunction. It has a relatively rapid onset of action, which may be suitable for a patient who is experiencing immediate symptoms of depression."

916,"Question: A 17-year-old woman presents to an OBGYN clinic for evaluation of primary amenorrhea. She is a well-developed, well-nourished woman who looks her age. She has reached Tanner stage IV breast and pubic hair development, and her external genitalia appears normal. An ultrasound exam reveals no uterus, but both ovaries are present. A limited pelvic exam shows a shortened vaginal canal with no cervix. What is the likely pathophysiology underlying this condition?

Options:

A. Failure of the mesonephric duct to degenerate
B. Failure of the ovaries to produce estrogen
C. Genotype 47 XXY
D. Failure of the paramesonephric duct to form

Answer: D. Failure of the paramesonephric duct to form

Explanation:
Primary amenorrhea is a condition where a woman experiences the onset of sexual maturity, including breast and pubic hair development, without menstruation. In this case, the patient has reached Tanner stage IV breast and pubic hair development, indicating normal sexual maturation. However, the absence of a uterus and cervix on ultrasound suggests that the paramesonephric duct, which gives rise to the uterus and cervix, has failed to form properly. This is the most likely pathophysiology underlying the patient's condition.

Option A, failure of the mesonephric duct to degenerate, is unlikely as the patient has reached Tanner stage IV breast and pubic hair development, which is consistent with normal sexual maturation.

Option B, failure of the ovaries to produce estrogen, is also unlikely as the patient has reached Tanner stage IV breast and pubic hair development, which is consistent with normal sexual maturation. Additionally, the presence of both ovaries on ultrasound suggests that the ovaries are functioning normally.

Option C, genotype 47 XXY, is a rare genetic condition that can cause primary amenorrhea. However, the patient's history of normal sexual maturation and the presence of both ovaries on ultrasound suggest that this condition is unlikely.

Therefore, the most likely pathophysiology underlying the patient's condition is failure of the paramesonephric duct to form, which is the answer choice D."
917,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 17-year-old African-American male visits his family physician with a concern about red-tinged urine, which he first noticed during a recent cold. The patient reports that this has happened to him before, and his father is present to confirm that it's a recurring issue. What is the likely diagnosis for this patient?

Options:
A. Acute cystitis
B. Sickle cell trait
C. Acute glomerulonephritis
D. Hemophilia

Answer: B. Sickle cell trait.

Explanation: The patient's red-tinged urine could be due to a number of factors, including infection or inflammation. However, the patient's history of recurring red-tinged urine and the presence of his father, who also experiences this symptom, suggest that the patient may have sickle cell trait. Sickle cell trait is a genetic condition that affects the production of hemoglobin, which can cause red blood cells to take on a sickle shape and lead to symptoms such as red-tinged urine. While other conditions like acute cystitis or glomerulonephritis could also be possible, the patient's history and the presence of his father's similar symptoms make sickle cell trait the most likely diagnosis."
918,"Question: A previously healthy 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department 30 minutes after collapsing during soccer practice. His father died of sudden cardiac arrest at the age of 36 years. On examination, his pulse is 73/min and blood pressure is 125/78 mm Hg. Cardiac examination reveals:

Options:
A. Aortic root dilatation
B. Eccentric left ventricular dilation
C. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy
D. Mitral valve fibrinoid necrosis

Answer: C. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy

Explanation:
The patient's cardiac examination reveals a cardiac murmur, which suggests an abnormality in the heart. The ECG findings of large R waves in the lateral leads and deep S waves in V1 and V2 suggest a possible diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Aortic root dilatation is less likely as there are no signs of heart failure or aortic valve disease. Eccentric left ventricular dilation is also less likely as there are no signs of heart failure or a significant left ventricular dysfunction. Mitral valve fibrinoid necrosis is an uncommon condition that is not typically associated with a cardiac murmur.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation is asymmetric septal hypertrophy, which is a common condition in young adults and can lead to sudden cardiac death, as seen in the patient's father."
919,"Question: A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department after numerous episodes of vomiting, with the patient stating that he thinks he ""ate something weird"" and has been vomiting for the past 48 hours, with the last few times throwing up blood. He is hypotensive with a blood pressure of 90/55 mm Hg and a pulse of 120/min. After opening an intravenous line, a physical examination is performed which is normal except for mild epigastric tenderness. An immediate endoscopy is performed and a tear involving the mucosa and submucosa of the gastroesophageal junction is visualized. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Boerhaave syndrome - This is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the rupture of the esophageal mucosa, usually due to vomiting. However, the patient's symptoms and signs do not match this diagnosis.

B. Gastric ulcer - A gastric ulcer is a lesion that occurs on the stomach lining and can cause vomiting, abdominal pain, and bleeding. However, the patient's symptoms and signs do not match this diagnosis.

C. Hiatal hernia - A hiatal hernia occurs when the stomach bulges up into the chest through a weakened area in the diaphragm. While this can cause symptoms such as heartburn and difficulty swallowing, it does not typically cause vomiting or bleeding.

D. Mallory-Weiss tear - This is a tear in the mucosa and submucosa of the gastroesophageal junction that can cause vomiting blood and is often associated with alcohol consumption. The patient's symptoms and signs match this diagnosis, making it the most likely explanation for their condition.

Answer: D. Mallory-Weiss tear"
920,"Question: A 24-year-old man presents with severe lower back pain for the past 2 days, characterized as constant and non-radiating, and rated 7/10 in intensity. He recently assisted a friend move into a new apartment and has a history of intravenous heroin use. His vital signs are within normal limits, except for a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F). Examination reveals old track marks on both cubital fossae and firm, tense lumbar paraspinal muscles on palpation, with no midline spinal tenderness or aggravation of pain with hip and knee flexion and extension. Urinalysis is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Analgesia and regular activity: Given the patient's history of intravenous heroin use and current symptoms of lower back pain, it is possible that the pain is related to his drug use. Analgesia and regular activity may help manage his symptoms, and he should be advised to avoid any strenuous activities that may exacerbate the pain.

B. MRI of the spine: An MRI of the spine may be useful in evaluating the patient's back pain, as it can help identify any structural abnormalities or inflammation in the spine that may be causing the pain. However, given the patient's recent history of heroin use, it is possible that the pain is related to his drug use rather than a spinal condition.

C. Measurement of serum HLA-B27: HLA-B27 is a genetic marker that is associated with an increased risk of developing inflammatory diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis and other forms of spinal inflammation. Measuring the patient's serum HLA-B27 level may help confirm the diagnosis of a spinal inflammatory condition, but this test is not typically performed as a first step in management.

D. Spinal traction: Spinal traction is not a recommended next step in management for this patient, as it is not likely to alleviate his lower back pain and may even cause further injury."
921,"Question: A previously healthy 73-year-old man comes to the physician at his wife's insistence because of a skin lesion on his back. He lives with his wife and works for a high-profile law firm where he represents several major clients. Physical examination shows a 7-mm, brownish-black papule with irregular borders. When the doctor starts to mention possible diagnoses, the patient interrupts her and says that he does not want to know the diagnosis and that she should just do whatever she thinks is right. A biopsy of the skin lesion is performed and histological examination shows clusters of infiltrative melanocytes. Upon repeat questioning, the patient reaffirms his wish to not know the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate response from the physician?

A. ""I would like to do further testing to investigate how far this cancer has spread.""

This option is not the most appropriate response because the patient has explicitly stated that he does not want to know the diagnosis. The physician should respect the patient's wishes and not pursue further testing or treatment without his consent.

B. ""I don't have to tell you, but I will have to tell your wife so we can plan your therapy.""

This option is also not the most appropriate response because the patient has clearly stated that he does not want to know the diagnosis. The physician should not reveal the diagnosis to the patient's wife without his consent.

C. ""I'll have to consult with the ethics committee to determine further steps.""

This option is not the most appropriate response because the patient's request not to know the diagnosis is a personal decision and not an ethical dilemma that requires consultation with an ethics committee.

D. ""I would like to know more about why you don't want to hear your test results.""

This option is the most appropriate response because it acknowledges the patient's request and expresses a willingness to listen to his reasons for not wanting to know the diagnosis. This can help the physician better understand the patient's motivations and provide appropriate care."
922,"Question: A 53-year-old woman presents with superficial erosions and blisters on her head and trunk, as well as significant involvement of her buccal mucosa, making eating difficult. She had previously developed tender sores on her oral mucosa and soft palate, which worsened despite treatment, leading to eroded areas on her trunk and extremities and a 10 kg weight loss. Upon examination, she notes that the top layer of her skin can be easily removed when firm horizontal pressure is applied. What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient's condition?

Options:

A. Toxic epidermal necrolysis
B. Pemphigus vulgaris
C. Dermatitis herpetiformis
D. Behcet's disease

Answer: B. Pemphigus vulgaris

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of superficial erosions and blisters, particularly on the head and trunk, as well as the involvement of the buccal mucosa, are consistent with Pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune blistering disorder. The patient's history of tender sores on the oral mucosa and soft palate, which worsened despite initial treatment, also supports this diagnosis. The patient's observation that the top layer of her skin can be easily removed when firm horizontal pressure is applied is also consistent with Pemphigus vulgaris, as the disorder is characterized by the formation of blisters and erosions due to the autoimmune attack on the skin. Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Dermatitis herpetiformis, and Behcet's disease are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and presentation."
923,"Question: A 22-year-old man is rushed to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient states that he feels weakness and numbness in both of his legs. He also reports pain in his lower back. His airway, breathing, and circulation is intact, and he is conversational. Neurologic exam is significant for bilateral lower extremity flaccid paralysis and impaired pain and temperature sensation up to T10-T11 with normal vibration sense. A computerized tomography scan of the spine is performed which shows a vertebral burst fracture of the vertebral body at the level of T11. Which of the following findings is most likely present in this patient?

Options:

A. Preserved fine touch - This option is unlikely, as the patient is experiencing numbness and weakness in both legs, indicating damage to the sensory and motor functions of the spinal cord.

B. Preserved crude touch - This option is also unlikely, as the patient's neurological examination reveals impaired pain and temperature sensation up to T10-T11, which suggests damage to the sensory function of the spinal cord.

C. Hyperreflexia at the level of the lesion - This option is possible, as a vertebral burst fracture can cause a lesion in the spinal cord that can result in hyperreflexia, which is an exaggerated reflex response.

D. Normal bladder function - This option is unlikely, as the patient's neurological examination reveals impaired sensation in the lower back and legs, which can lead to urinary incontinence or retention.

Answer: A. Preserved fine touch"
924,"Question: The 23-year-old man presents to the emergency department for 2 days of severe headaches, primarily located on the left forehead and eye. He has a history of similar symptoms last summer and has been taking indomethacin every 6 hours without relief. He is a daily smoker and works in a stressful accounting job. On examination, he shows drooping of the left eyelid, tearing of the left eye, and rhinorrhea, with a dilated left pupil and localized tenderness along the right supraspinatus muscle. Which of the following conditions is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Giant cell arteritis - This condition is a rare inflammatory disorder that affects the arteries, including those in the head and neck. While it can cause headaches, it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with cluster headaches.

B. Medication overuse headache - The patient's frequent use of indomethacin may have contributed to the development of a medication overuse headache, which can cause daily headaches that worsen with activity and are relieved by rest. However, the patient's history of similar symptoms last summer and the presence of other symptoms such as drooping of the left eyelid and rhinorrhea suggest that another condition may be at play.

C. Cluster headache - This condition is characterized by recurring episodes of severe headache on one side of the head, often accompanied by tearing and redness of the eye, nasal congestion, and swelling of the eyelid. The patient's symptoms are highly consistent with cluster headaches, and the presence of localized tenderness along the right supraspinatus muscle may be related to the headache.

D. Trigeminal neuralgia - This condition is characterized by episodes of sudden, severe headache on one side of the face, often accompanied by tearing and redness of the eye, nasal congestion, and swelling of the eyelid. While the patient's symptoms could potentially be related to trigeminal neuralgia, the presence of drooping of the left eyelid and rhinorrhea suggest that another condition may be more likely."
925,"Question: A 38-year-old man presents for a follow-up examination after a burst fracture of the cervical spine. He has quadriparesis, urinary and bowel incontinence, and appears malnourished. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?

Options:

A. Cavitation within the spinal cord
B. Occlusion of the posterior spinal artery
C. Hemi-transection of the spinal cord
D. Damage to the anterior spinal artery

Answer: D. Damage to the anterior spinal artery

The patient's symptoms, including quadriparesis, urinary and bowel incontinence, and malnourishment, are consistent with damage to the anterior spinal artery, which supplies blood to the cervical spine. The erythema over the sacrum, spasticity in all extremities, decreased muscle strength in both proximal and distal muscle groups, and decreased rectal tone also support this diagnosis. While cavitation within the spinal cord, occlusion of the posterior spinal artery, and hemi-transection of the spinal cord could also cause similar symptoms, the most likely cause in this case is damage to the anterior spinal artery."
926,"Question: A 60-year-old man presents with progressive pain in his right hip and lower back over the past 4 weeks, describing the pain as dull and constant, worse with exertion and at night. He has helped his son with renovating his home, which required heavy lifting and kneeling, and his father died of prostate cancer. His vital signs are normal, and examination shows localized tenderness over the right hip and groin area with decreased range of motion. Laboratory tests reveal:

Hemoglobin: 15 g/dL
Serum Total Protein: 6.5 g/dL
Bilirubin: 0.8 mg/dL
Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT): 20 U/L
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP): 950 U/L
γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT): 40 U/L (normal range: 5-50 U/L)
Calcium: 9 mg/dL
Phosphate: 4 mg/dL
Parathyroid Hormone (PTH): 450 pg/mL

An X-ray of the hip shows cortical thickening and prominent trabecular markings. Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely underlying mechanism of his symptoms is:

A. Increased rate of bone remodeling

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive pain in the right hip and lower back, worse with exertion and at night, are consistent with increased bone remodeling. The patient's recent heavy lifting and kneeling may have triggered an increase in bone remodeling, leading to the development of osteoarthritis. The laboratory results support this diagnosis, as the elevated GGT levels suggest an increase in bone resorption, a hallmark of bone remodeling."
927,"Question: A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife due to lethargy, confusion, and nausea for the past 2 days. He has no previous medical history and takes a daily multivitamin and acetaminophen for hip pain. His vital signs are normal, but he is disoriented and recognizes his wife. The physical examination shows no abnormalities, and laboratory tests reveal a hemoglobin concentration of 9.1 g/dL, a serum calcium concentration of 14.7 mg/dL, and a serum creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL (previously 0.9 mg/dL). Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's condition?

A. Ectopic PTHrP release
B. Increased serum levels of 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D
C. Excess PTH secretion from parathyroid glands
D. Overproliferation of plasma cells

Answer: D. Overproliferation of plasma cells

Rationale: The patient's elevated serum calcium and creatinine levels, along with his disorientation and confusion, suggest that there may be an overactive immune response occurring in his body. Overproliferation of plasma cells is a common feature of various autoimmune disorders, including multiple myeloma, and can lead to the production of abnormal proteins that can cause confusion, disorientation, and other neurological symptoms. The patient's recent onset of symptoms and lack of any previous medical history also support this diagnosis."
928,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 61-year-old woman is brought to an urgent care clinic by her husband with an altered mental status. The patient's husband reports that her symptoms began acutely 24 hours ago, with sudden onset of excessive drowsiness and rapid deterioration. The patient is arousable but non-responsive to commands, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 10/15. Physical examination reveals multiple black skin lesions on the trunk, approximately 4 cm in diameter and round with a necrotic center forming an eschar. Laboratory results show:

Hemoglobin: 14.2 g/dL
White Blood Cell Count: 3,700/μL
Neutrophils: 22%
Lymphocytes: 52%
Monocytes: 17%
Eosinophils: 5%

Blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Which of the following factors is most likely responsible for this patient's condition?

A. Failure of immunosuppressive therapy
B. Decreased interleukin-2 levels
C. DiGeorge Syndrome
D. Decreased phagocytic cell count

Answer: D. Decreased phagocytic cell count"
929,"Question: A 22-year-old female presents to her physician for evaluation of a vaginal discharge, itching, and irritation. She recently started a new relationship with her boyfriend, who is her only sexual partner. He does not report any genitourinary symptoms. She takes oral contraceptives and does not use barrier contraception. The medical history is unremarkable. The vital signs are within normal limits. A gynecologic examination reveals a thin, yellow, frothy vaginal discharge with a musty, unpleasant odor and numerous punctate red maculae on the ectocervix. The remainder of the exam is normal. Which of the following organisms will most likely be revealed on wet mount microscopy?

Options:

A. Budding yeasts cells and/or pseudohyphae - This option is unlikely, as the vaginal discharge is not typically associated with budding yeast cells.

B. Epithelial cells covered by numerous bacterial cells - This option is possible, as bacterial vaginosis is a common cause of vaginal discharge, itching, and irritation. However, the presence of numerous punctate red maculae on the ectocervix suggests that the patient may have a different infection.

C. Motile round or oval-shaped microorganisms - This option is the most likely, as the patient's symptoms and the appearance of the vaginal discharge are consistent with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

D. Chains of cocci - This option is unlikely, as there is no mention of any bacterial chain formation in the patient's symptoms or examination findings.

Answer: C. Motile round or oval-shaped microorganisms."
930,"Question: A 37-year-old woman, gravida 4, para 3, at 35 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. Her three children were delivered by Cesarean section. One hour after vaginal delivery, the placenta is not delivered. Manual separation of the placenta leads to profuse vaginal bleeding. Her pulse is 122/min and blood pressure is 90/67 mm Hg. A firm, nontender uterine fundus is palpated at the level of the umbilicus. Hemoglobin is 8.3 g/dL and platelet count is 220,000/mm3. Activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's postpartum bleeding?

A. Impaired uterine contractions

B. Consumption of intravascular clotting factors

C. Rupture of the uterine wall

D. Defective decidual layer of the placenta

Answer: D. Defective decidual layer of the placenta

Rationale: The patient's postpartum bleeding is likely due to a defect in the decidual layer of the placenta, which is the most likely underlying mechanism. The patient's history of previous Cesarean sections and the failure to deliver the placenta after vaginal delivery suggest that the placenta may have been inadequately separated, leading to bleeding. The other options are less likely causes of the patient's bleeding, as impaired uterine contractions and consumption of intravascular clotting factors are not typically associated with postpartum bleeding, and a rupture of the uterine wall is unlikely given the patient's age and parity."
931,"Question: A 64-year-old woman has progressively worsening abdominal pain 5 hours after an open valve replacement with cardiopulmonary bypass. The pain is crampy and associated with an urge to defecate. The patient reports having had 2 bloody bowel movements in the last hour. Her operation was complicated by significant intraoperative blood loss, which prolonged the operation and necessitated 2 transfusions of red blood cells. She has hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient received prophylactic perioperative antibiotics and opioid pain management during recovery. Her temperature is 37.9°C (98.9°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 115/69 mm Hg. Examination shows a soft abdomen with mild tenderness to palpation in the left quadrants but no rebound tenderness or guarding. Bowel sounds are decreased. Rectal examination shows blood on the examining finger. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?

A. Decreased blood flow to the splenic flexure: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody stools, and decreased bowel sounds are consistent with ischemia or infarction of the splenic flexure, which is a common complication of cardiac surgery. Decreased blood flow to the splenic flexure can lead to necrosis of the tissue, causing abdominal pain and other symptoms.

B. Small outpouchings in the sigmoid wall: This option is unlikely, as there is no mention of any abnormalities in the sigmoid wall or any other part of the abdomen.

C. Atherosclerotic narrowing of the intestinal vessels: While the patient has hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, there is no mention of any intestinal vessel narrowing or obstruction.

D. Infection with Clostridioides difficile: While the patient has bloody stools, which can be a symptom of infection with Clostridioides difficile, there is no mention of any other symptoms or signs of infection, such as fever or abdominal tenderness.

Answer: A. Decreased blood flow to the splenic flexure"
932,"Question: A 38-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her obstetrician for a prenatal visit. She reports feeling well and has no acute concerns. She is currently at 28 weeks gestation previously confirmed by ultrasound. She takes her folate supplements daily. On physical exam, the uterus is soft and globular. The top of the uterine fundus is found around the level of the umbilicus. A fetal ultrasound demonstrates a reduced liver volume and subcutaneous fat with relative sparing of the head. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's ultrasound findings?

Options:

A. Aneuploidy - This is unlikely to be the cause of the reduced liver volume and subcutaneous fat observed in the patient's ultrasound findings. Aneuploidy is a genetic disorder that can result in structural abnormalities or impaired organ development, but it is not typically associated with a specific pattern of organ distribution.

B. Cigarette smoking - Cigarette smoking has been linked to a variety of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including reduced fetal growth and organ development. The patient's ultrasound findings are consistent with this possibility, as the reduced liver volume and subcutaneous fat may be related to the maternal smoking exposure.

C. Fetal congenital heart disease - While fetal congenital heart disease can occur, it is relatively rare and typically presents with a different pattern of organ distribution on ultrasound. The patient's ultrasound findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

D. Fetal infection - Fetal infections can cause a range of organ dysfunction, including the liver and subcutaneous tissues. However, the patient's ultrasound findings do not suggest the presence of an infection.

Answer: B. Cigarette smoking"
933,"Question: A 36-year-old Asian G4P3 presents to her physician for a first prenatal visit with a recently diagnosed pregnancy at an estimated gestational age of 5 weeks. She has a history of two vaginal deliveries and one medical abortion, and her children had birth weights of 4100 g and 4560 g. Her medical history also includes gastroesophageal reflux disease, for which she takes pantoprazole. At the time of presentation, her weight is 79 kg (174 lb), and her height is 157 cm (5 ft 1 in). Her vital signs are normal, except for mild increased adiposity. Which of the following tests is indicated in this woman?

A. Serology for CMV (Cytomegalovirus)
B. Coagulogram (to check for blood clotting disorders)
C. Liver enzyme assessment (to check for liver dysfunction)
D. Glucose oral tolerance test (to check for gestational diabetes)

Answer: D. Glucose oral tolerance test

Rationale: The patient's history of two previous vaginal deliveries and one medical abortion increases her risk for gestational diabetes. The glucose oral tolerance test can help identify this condition, which is important to manage during pregnancy to ensure a healthy pregnancy outcome. The other options are not as relevant to this patient's presentation."

936,"Question: A 19-year-old woman with metastatic Ewing sarcoma has undergone multiple treatments without improvement and has decided to stop treatment and pursue only palliative care. Her mother objects and insists that treatments continue. What should be done?

A. Continue treatments until the patient has a psychiatric evaluation: This option is not relevant to the situation as the patient has already made a decision to stop treatment and pursue palliative care. A psychiatric evaluation may be necessary to ensure the patient's mental health is stable, but it is not a solution to the conflict between the patient and her mother.

B. Halt treatments and begin palliative care: This is the most appropriate option as the patient has made a decision to stop treatment and focus on managing her symptoms and improving her quality of life. Halting treatments and shifting to palliative care will allow the patient to receive the care and support she needs to manage her condition and maintain her dignity.

C. Try to seek additional experimental treatments that are promising: This option is not appropriate as the patient has already undergone multiple treatments without improvement. Pursuing additional experimental treatments may not be in the patient's best interest and could potentially cause harm.

D. Continue treatment because otherwise, the patient will die: This option is not a valid reason to continue treatment as the patient has already made a decision to stop treatment and pursue palliative care. It is important to respect the patient's autonomy and decisions regarding their own healthcare.

Answer: B. Halt treatments and begin palliative care."
937,"Question: A 58-year-old man with liver cirrhosis presents to his primary care physician complaining of increased abdominal girth and early satiety. He drinks 2–4 glasses of wine with dinner and recalls having had abnormal liver enzymes in the past. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, and a pulse of 75/min.

Abdominal ultrasonography confirms the presence of ascites. Diagnostic paracentesis is performed and its results are shown:
Polymorphonuclear cell count 10 cells/mm
Ascitic protein 1 g/dL

Which of the following best represents the mechanism of ascites in this patient?

A. Peritoneal carcinomatosis
B. Serositis
C. High sinusoidal pressure
D. Pancreatic disease

Answer: C. High sinusoidal pressure

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of increased abdominal girth and early satiety, along with the physical examination findings of telangiectasias, mild splenomegaly, and palpable firm liver, suggest that the ascites in this patient is likely due to high sinusoidal pressure. This is a common complication of liver cirrhosis, which can lead to increased pressure in the sinusoids and fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity. The patient's history of abnormal liver enzymes and the presence of ascites on ultrasonography also support this diagnosis. Peritoneal carcinomatosis, serositis, and pancreatic disease are less likely causes of ascites in this patient."
938,"Question: A 15-year-old boy visits the physician due to severe muscle cramps and pain lasting 3 months. He first experienced these symptoms while trying out for the high school football team. After brief rest, his symptoms improve, but he experiences severe muscle pain and swelling after 10 minutes of playing, followed by reddish-brown urine 2 days ago. There is no family history of serious illness, and vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. Serum creatine kinase concentration is 333 U/L. Urinalysis reveals:

B. Myophosphorylase deficiency

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of severe muscle cramps and pain, fatigue, and reddish-brown urine are consistent with myophosphorylase deficiency, a rare genetic disorder that affects the muscles. Myophosphorylase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in glycolysis and muscle function. Deficiency in this enzyme can lead to muscle weakness, cramps, and pain, especially after physical activity. The patient's symptoms improve after brief rest, which supports the diagnosis of myophosphorylase deficiency.

Option A, thyroid hormone deficiency, is unlikely as there is no history of thyroid problems, and thyroid hormone levels are within normal limits.

Option C, acid maltase deficiency, is also unlikely as there is no history of neurological symptoms or signs of neurological damage.

Option D, CTG repeat in the DMPK gene, is a rare genetic disorder that can cause muscle weakness and cramps, but it is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms based on the information provided."
939,"Question: A 31-year-old male comedian seeks psychotherapy for depressive symptoms. During the session, you explore how he channels his emotions about his abusive childhood into comedy routines.

Which of the following defense mechanisms is this patient exhibiting?

Options:
A. Denial - The patient is avoiding direct discussion of his childhood experiences, which could be a sign of denial.
B. Reaction formation - The patient's sudden resistance to discussing his childhood may be a form of reaction formation, where he is unconsciously rejecting the emotions associated with those experiences.
C. Splitting - The patient's tendency to idealize some coworkers while dismissing others as ""incompetent"" could be a sign of splitting, where he is dividing people into good and bad categories.
D. Suppression - The patient's avoidance of eye contact and reluctance to discuss his childhood may be a form of suppression, where he is consciously or unconsciously pushing his emotions away.

Answer: C. Splitting"
940,"Question: A 60-year-old man comes to the clinic with knee pain for the past few weeks. The pain is located in the left knee, associated with morning stiffness for about an hour, and improves with activities throughout the day. He also has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, and ischemic heart disease. He underwent angioplasty last year for a STEMI. The patient takes metformin, aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, ramipril, omeprazole, and bisoprolol. He used to smoke one pack of cigarettes a day for the last 45 years but stopped smoking for the past one year following his heart attack. He drinks alcohol socially. His father has Alzheimer’s disease and is in adult home care, and his mother died of breast cancer when she was 55. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.8°F), blood pressure is 132/65 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and BMI is 22 kg/m2. On examination, his left knee is swollen, warm, tender to touch, and has decreased range of movement due to pain. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations are negative. Laboratory investigation is shown below:

Complete blood count:
Hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL
Leukocytes 14,000/mm3
Platelets 155,000/mm3
ESR 40 mm/hr

What is the best next step in the management of this patient?

B. Synovial fluid analysis

Explanation:
The patient's knee pain, swelling, warmth, and limited range of motion are consistent with knee osteoarthritis. However, the patient's history of ischemic heart disease and recent STEMI raise the possibility of a cardiac etiology for the knee pain. Synovial fluid analysis can help to determine if there is any inflammation or infection in the knee joint, which could be related to the cardiac disease. Therefore, synovial fluid analysis is the best next step in the management of this patient."
941,"Question: A 78-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction status post coronary artery bypass grafting and a 60-pack-year history of smoking is found deceased in his apartment after not returning calls to his family for the last 2 days. The man was last known to be alive 3 days ago, when his neighbor saw him getting his mail. The family requests an autopsy. On autopsy, the man is found to have a 100% blockage of his left anterior descending artery of his heart and likely passed from sudden cardiac death 2 days prior. Which of the following findings is expected to be found on histologic examination of his damaged myocardium?

A. Cellular debris and macrophages: It is expected that there will be a significant amount of cellular debris and macrophages present in the damaged myocardium of the deceased individual, given the history of myocardial infarction and the recent blockage of the left anterior descending artery. Macrophages are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the cleanup of damaged tissue, and their presence in the myocardium can indicate the extent of the injury.

B. Cystic cavitation: Cystic cavitation is not a likely finding on histologic examination of the damaged myocardium in this case, as it is typically associated with chronic conditions such as fibrosis or fatty infiltration.

C. Fat saponification: Fat saponification is also not a likely finding on histologic examination of the damaged myocardium in this case, as it is a process that occurs in the setting of advanced coronary artery disease and long-standing smoking.

D. Uniform binding of acidophilic dyes: Given the history of myocardial infarction and the recent blockage of the left anterior descending artery, it is highly likely that there will be a uniform binding of acidophilic dyes in the damaged myocardium. Acidophilic dyes are a type of stain that binds to the sarcolemma of cardiac myocytes, and their uniform distribution in the myocardium can indicate the extent of the injury.

Answer: D. Uniform binding of acidophilic dyes."

He has a history of paranoid schizophrenia and hypertension, and his current medications are chlorpromazine and amlodipine. On examination, he appears ill, is not oriented to time, place, or person, and has a temperature of 40°C (104°F), pulse of 130/min, respirations of 29/min, and blood pressure of 155/100 mm Hg. Examination also reveals diaphoresis, increased muscle tone bilaterally, 1+ deep tendon reflexes bilaterally, psychomotor agitation, incoherent speech, clear lungs, and a supple neck. Laboratory analysis shows a leukocyte count of 11,300/mm3 and serum creatine kinase concentration of 833 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?

A. Dantrolene: Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that can help manage the increased muscle tone and agitation observed in this patient. It is an appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient.

B. Clozapine: Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication that can help manage the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. However, it may take some time to reach therapeutic levels in the body, and it may not be the most appropriate choice for managing acute agitation and confusion in this patient.

C. Cyproheptadine: Cyproheptadine is an antihistamine that can help manage agitation and confusion. However, it may not be as effective in managing the muscle rigidity and tone observed in this patient.

D. Physostigmine: Physostigmine is an anticholinergic medication that can help manage agitation and confusion. However, it may not be the most appropriate choice for managing muscle rigidity and tone in this patient.

Answer: A. Dantrolene"
944,"Question: A 58-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with complaints of chest pain and palpitations. A thorough past medical history reveals a diagnosis of rheumatic fever during childhood. Echocardiography is conducted and shows enlargement of the left atrium and narrowing of the mitral valve opening. Which of the following sounds should the physician expect to hear on cardiac auscultation?

Options:

A. Holosystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla - This is not a typical murmur associated with mitral valve prolapse or narrowing of the mitral valve opening.

B. Opening snap following the aortic component of the S2 heart sound - This is a characteristic finding in patients with mitral valve prolapse or narrowing of the mitral valve opening, and is often referred to as a ""snap"" or ""click"" sound.

C. Continuous, machine-like murmur - This could be a murmur associated with other cardiac conditions, such as an atrial septal defect or ventricular hypertrophy.

D. High-pitched, blowing decrescendo murmur in early diastole - This is also not a typical murmur associated with mitral valve prolapse or narrowing of the mitral valve opening.

Answer: B. Opening snap following the aortic component of the S2 heart sound."
945,"Question: A 62-year-old woman presents to her physician with persistent fatigue, nighttime sweating, and weight loss despite no changes in her diet or lifestyle. On examination, her temperature is 101.0°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 134/83 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 19/min, with enlarged lymph nodes noted during physical examination. Laboratory tests reveal an abnormally high concentration of a protein arranged in a pentameric complex on serum electrophoresis. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be causing the patient's symptoms?

A. Calcitriol secretion
B. Jaw lesion
C. Retinal hemorrhage
D. Sjogren syndrome

Answer: C. Retinal hemorrhage

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of persistent fatigue, nighttime sweating, and weight loss are consistent with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, a type of cancer that affects the plasma cells in the bone marrow. The abnormal protein concentration in the blood, as revealed by the pentameric complex on serum electrophoresis, is a hallmark of multiple myeloma. Retinal hemorrhage is a common complication of multiple myeloma, and its presence in this patient suggests that the disease has progressed to an advanced stage. Calcitriol secretion is not a symptom of multiple myeloma, and jaw lesions are not typically associated with this condition. Sjogren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands, including the salivary and lacrimal glands, and is not typically associated with multiple myeloma."
946,"Question: A 15-year-old teenager is brought to the emergency department via emergency medical services (EMS) after a motor vehicle accident. The patient is in critical condition and is hemodynamically unstable. It becomes clear that the patient may require a blood transfusion, and the parents are consulted for consent. However, the parents are Jehovah's Witnesses and refuse to give their consent for the blood transfusion, citing their religious beliefs. The patient, on the other hand, is adamant about receiving the transfusion to save their life. What is the most appropriate course of action?

A. Give the patient the blood transfusion despite the parents' refusal.
B. Do not give the blood transfusion due to the parents' steadfast refusal.
C. Consult the hospital ethics committee to explore possible solutions.
D. Obtain a court order to compel the parents to allow the blood transfusion.

Answer: A. Give the patient the blood transfusion.

Explanation: In this scenario, the patient's wishes and medical needs take precedence over the parents' religious beliefs. The patient has the right to receive medical treatment that could save their life, including blood transfusions. While it is important to respect the parents' religious beliefs, the patient's autonomy and right to make decisions about their own medical care take precedence in this situation. Giving the patient the blood transfusion without the parents' consent is the most appropriate course of action to ensure the patient's well-being and safety."

949,"Question: A 17-year-old boy presents with a non-itchy rash on his chest that has been present for 1 week, following a recent trip to Puerto Rico. He started using a new laundry detergent after his return. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus under control with insulin, and his family history includes Hashimoto thyroiditis in his mother and severe facial acne in his sister. Examination of the skin reveals multiple, non-tender, round, hypopigmented macules on the chest and trunk, with fine scaling when the lesions are scraped with a spatula. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?

A. Autoimmune destruction of melanocytes
B. Increased growth of Malassezia globosa
C. Antigen uptake by Langerhans cells
D. Infection with Trichophyton rubrum

Answer: B. Increased growth of Malassezia globosa

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of a non-itchy rash on his chest, along with the presence of multiple, round, hypopigmented macules, are consistent with a Malassezia infection. Malassezia globosa is a common fungus that can cause skin irritation and infection, particularly in warm, humid environments. The patient's recent trip to Puerto Rico and the use of a new laundry detergent may have contributed to the growth of Malassezia globosa on his skin, leading to the development of the rash. Autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, antigen uptake by Langerhans cells, and infection with Trichophyton rubrum are less likely mechanisms for the patient's symptoms based on the presented information."
950,"Question: A 50-year-old man presents to the physician with complaints of diffuse weakness over several months, along with an anterior mediastinal mass visible on a lateral chest x-ray obtained as part of a pre-employment medical evaluation. He also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and is currently taking rabeprazole. His height is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) and weight is 77 kg (170 lb), resulting in a BMI of 24.3 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits, and there is no evidence of lymphadenopathy in the cervical or axillary regions. The cardiopulmonary examination reveals no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender, with no signs of splenomegaly. Further evaluation of this patient is likely to reveal:

B. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of diffuse weakness and the presence of an anterior mediastinal mass on chest x-ray suggest the possibility of a neurological disorder, such as a myasthenic syndrome. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies are commonly detected in patients with myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that affects the nervous system and causes muscle weakness. The patient's history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and current treatment with rabeprazole do not affect the likelihood of this diagnosis."
951,"Question: A 59-year-old woman presents with upper extremity weakness and fatigue for the past 4 months, along with difficulty combing her hair and lifting objects. She has also experienced difficulty rising from her bed in the mornings for the past 2 months. Over the past month, she started using over-the-counter mouth rinses for dry mouth. The patient has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. Examination reveals decreased deep tendon reflexes, increased reflex activity with repetitive muscle tapping, and no fasciculations or muscle atrophy. A low-dose CT scan of the chest shows a 3-cm mass with heterogeneous calcifications in the center of the right lung. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism responsible for the patient's current symptoms?

A. Metastasis: The mass detected on the CT scan could be a metastasis from a primary tumor, such as lung cancer, which could be causing the patient's symptoms.

B. Inflammation: The inflammation in the lung tissue could be causing the patient's symptoms, such as coughing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing.

C. Autoimmunity: Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, can cause muscle weakness and fatigue, as well as other symptoms such as joint pain and swelling. The patient's history of smoking may also contribute to the development of an autoimmune disorder.

D. Invasion: The invasion of the lung tissue by a foreign substance, such as a bacterial infection, could cause the patient's symptoms.

Answer: C. Autoimmunity. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of a mass in the lung suggest the possibility of an autoimmune disorder, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which could be causing the patient's muscle weakness and fatigue."
952,"Question: A 19-year-old woman presents for a sports physical. She reports feeling healthy and having no concerns. Her past medical history includes depression and seasonal allergies, and she is currently taking fluoxetine and oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptive pills. Her family history reveals a sister with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). The patient denies any current or past use of alcohol, recreational drugs, or smoking, and she has been on oral birth control pills since age 14. She reports inconsistent condom use and no history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). She received the HPV vaccination series starting at age 11. Her vital signs are normal, and the physical examination is unremarkable. Based on this information, which of the following guidelines for cervical cancer screening are appropriate for this patient at this time?

A. Cytology (Pap smear) every 3 years
B. Cytology (Pap smear) and HPV DNA co-testing every 5 years
C. No cervical cancer screening is indicated at this time
D. Cytology (Pap smear) and HPV DNA co-testing every 3 years

Answer: C. No cervical cancer screening is indicated at this time

Rationale: The patient is 19 years old and has no history of cervical cancer or abnormal Pap smear results. The American Cancer Society guidelines recommend that women with a normal Pap smear and no history of cervical cancer or abnormal results can safely delay their first cervical cancer screening until age 21. Therefore, at this time, no cervical cancer screening is indicated for this patient."
953,"Question: A 41-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider with abdominal pain. She experiences a three-hour history of right upper quadrant sharp pain that started after her last meal, without any nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits. She has a history of multiple similar episodes over the past two years. What is the hormone responsible for this patient's pain?

Options:
A. Increase pancreatic bicarbonate secretion
B. Promote gallbladder relaxation
C. Promote migrating motor complexes
D. Promote relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi

Answer: D. Promote relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi.

Explanation: The sphincter of Oddi is a muscular ring that encircles the common bile duct and pancreatic duct, regulating the flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the small intestine. When the sphincter of Oddi is relaxed, bile and pancreatic juice can flow more easily into the small intestine, which can help to alleviate abdominal pain caused by gallstones or pancreatitis. Therefore, the hormone responsible for the patient's pain is likely to be a relaxant of the sphincter of Oddi, such as cholecystokinin (CCK)."
954,"Question: A 28-year-old man visits his physician complaining of hematochezia over the last several days, along with tenesmus and bowel urgency without any abdominal pain. He has had several milder episodes over the past several years that resolved on their own. He has no history of a serious illness and takes no medications. His blood pressure is 129/85 mm Hg; temperature, 37.4°C (99.3°F); and pulse, 75/min. On physical exam, his abdominal examination shows mild tenderness on deep palpation of the left lower quadrant. Digital rectal examination reveals anal tenderness and fresh blood. Stool examination is negative for pathogenic bacteria and an ova and parasite test is negative. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 28 mm/h. Colonoscopy shows diffuse erythema involving the rectum and extending to the distal sigmoid. The mucosa also shows a decreased vascular pattern with fine granularity. The remaining colon and distal ileum are normal. Biopsy of the inflamed mucosa of the sigmoid colon shows distorted crypt architecture. The most appropriate next step is to administer which of the following?

B. Mesalamine

Mesalamine is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition. It is an anti-inflammatory medication that is commonly used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis. The patient's symptoms of hematochezia, tenesmus, and bowel urgency, along with the findings of the colonoscopy and biopsy, are consistent with ulcerative colitis. Mesalamine can help to reduce the inflammation and symptoms of the disease, and may potentially prevent complications such as colon cancer. Azathioprine, Metronidazole, and Total parenteral nutrition are not the most appropriate options for this patient's condition."
955,"Question: A 33-year-old man presents with a 2-month history of burning epigastric pain, dry cough, and occasional regurgitation. The pain worsens with eating and lying down. Physical examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen. Upper endoscopy shows hyperemia in the distal third of the esophagus. Which of the following drugs is most likely to directly inhibit the common pathway of gastric acid secretion?

Options:

A. Pirenzepine: Pirenzepine is a selective cholinergic antagonist that can decrease gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the vagus nerve, which innervates the stomach. However, pirenzepine does not directly inhibit the common pathway of gastric acid secretion.

B. Ranitidine: Ranitidine is a histamine receptor antagonist that can directly inhibit the secretion of gastric acid by blocking the action of histamine on parietal cells in the stomach. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

C. Aluminum hydroxide: Aluminum hydroxide is an antacid that can neutralize gastric acid by binding to hydroxyl ions in the stomach. However, it does not directly inhibit the common pathway of gastric acid secretion.

D. Lansoprazole: Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that can directly inhibit the secretion of gastric acid by blocking the proton pump in the parietal cells of the stomach. This is the most common pathway of gastric acid secretion, and lansoprazole is the most likely drug to directly inhibit it.

Answer: D. Lansoprazole"
956,"Question: A 42-year-old woman presents with an 8-month history of intermittent pain and stiffness in her hands and feet, occurring approximately three times a month after waking up, lasting for about an hour, accompanied by fever and myalgia. She takes ibuprofen for relief, and her last episode occurred 5 days ago. She has no known medical conditions and is otherwise healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits, and examination reveals mild swelling and tenderness in the wrists and proximal interphalangeal joints of both hands. An X-ray of her hands is shown. Which of the following medications would be the most appropriate treatment?

Options:
A. Methotrexate: Methotrexate is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) that is commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. It works by inhibiting the production of inflammatory enzymes and reducing inflammation in the joints.
B. Adalimumab: Adalimumab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor that is used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. It works by blocking the action of TNF, a protein that promotes inflammation.
C. Prednisolone: Prednisolone is a corticosteroid that is commonly used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. It is often used to treat acute flares of rheumatoid arthritis, as well as other inflammatory conditions.
D. Diclofenac: Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to treat pain and inflammation in the joints. It works by blocking the production of prostaglandins, which are pro-inflammatory molecules.

Answer: A. Methotrexate"
957,"Question:

An 8-month-old boy is brought to a medical office by his mother, complaining of fussiness and poor feeding. Despite the mother's concerns about the baby's weight gain, the physical examination reveals that the boy is crying intensely when his abdomen is palpated. The abdomen is distended with tympany in the left lower quadrant. Based on these findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A. Meckel diverticulum
B. DiGeorge syndrome
C. Duodenal atresia
D. Hirschsprung disease

Answer: D. Hirschsprung disease.

The symptoms described in the question, such as fussiness, poor feeding, and abdominal distension with tympany in the left lower quadrant, are consistent with Hirschsprung disease, a condition caused by the failure of specialized cells to migrate during fetal development. This results in a lack of ganglion cells in the distal portion of the intestine, leading to constipation and abdominal pain. While Meckel diverticulum, DiGeorge syndrome, and duodenal atresia can also cause abdominal symptoms, Hirschsprung disease is the most likely diagnosis based on the presented symptoms and physical examination findings."
958,"Question: A 12-year-old girl is brought to an oncologist, as she was recently diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. Cytogenetic studies reveal that the tumor is responsive to vinblastine, which is a cell-cycle specific anticancer agent. It acts on the M phase of the cell cycle and inhibits the growth of cells. Which of the following statements best describes the regulation of the cell cycle?

Format:

Question: [Question]
Options: [Options]
Answer: [Answer]

A. Cyclin-dependent activation of CDK1 (CDC2) takes place upon the entry of a cell into M phase of the cell cycle.

Explanation:
The cell cycle is regulated by a complex network of molecular interactions involving various cyclins, CDKs, and other proteins. During the G1 phase, cyclin D is synthesized and binds to CDK4/6, leading to the activation of the cell cycle. As the cell enters the S phase, cyclin E and A are synthesized and bind to CDK2, further activating the cell cycle. Upon exiting the S phase, the cell enters the G2 phase, where cyclin B is synthesized and binds to CDK1 (CDC2). This activation of CDK1 leads to the metaphase-to-anaphase transition and the eventual separation of the replicated chromosomes. Vinblastine, as an inhibitor of CDK1, specifically targets the M phase of the cell cycle and inhibits the progression of cells through this stage, leading to cell growth inhibition and potential cancer treatment.

B. EGF from a blood clot stimulates the growth and proliferation of cells in the healing process.

C. Inhibitors of DNA synthesis act in the M phase of the cell cycle.

D. Replication of the genome occurs in the M phase of the cell cycle.

Note: The options are reworded to provide a clearer and more concise explanation of the concept."
959,"Question: A 40-year-old woman presents with a 2-week history of anorexia and dry mouth, along with fatigue and difficulty performing daily tasks. She has lost 5.8 kg (12.8 lb) in weight over this period. One year ago, she was diagnosed with advanced cervical carcinoma that has metastasized to the pancreas and is currently undergoing combination chemotherapy. She is 157 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 47 kg (103.6 lb), resulting in a BMI of 19.1 kg/m2. She appears thin and pale, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), blood pressure of 110/68 mm Hg, pulse of 105/min, and respirations of 28/min. There is generalized weakness and atrophy of the skeletal muscles. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Mirtazapine: Mirtazapine is an antidepressant that can help manage anorexia and weight loss associated with cancer treatment. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management, as her weight loss and anorexia are more likely related to her underlying cancer and its treatment than to depression.

B. Megestrol acetate: Megestrol acetate is a synthetic progestin that can help manage weight gain and anorexia in patients with cancer. It can be used to treat cachexia, a condition characterized by unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and muscle wasting. In this patient, megestrol acetate may be an appropriate next step in management to help promote weight gain and improve her overall nutritional status.

C. Cyproheptadine: Cyproheptadine is an antihistamine that can help manage anorexia and weight loss associated with cancer treatment. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management, as her weight loss and anorexia are more likely related to her underlying cancer and its treatment than to histamine deficiency.

D. Cognitive behavioral therapy: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that can help patients manage the emotional and psychological distress associated with cancer and its treatment. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management, as her weight loss and anorexia are more likely related to her underlying cancer and its treatment than to psychological factors."

D. Type II hypersensitivity reaction - This is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's cardiac disease. The photomicrograph shows evidence of an inflammatory infiltrate in the myocardium, which is consistent with a Type II hypersensitivity reaction.

Answer: D. Type II hypersensitivity reaction."
961,"Question: A day after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina, a 63-year-old woman experiences severe pain in her right small toe. She has no prior history of similar episodes. She has had diabetes mellitus for 16 years. After the procedure, her blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, her pulse is 65 beats per minute, her respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and her temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F). Physical examination of the femoral artery access site shows no abnormalities, and distal pulses are palpable and symmetric. A photograph of the toe is provided. Which of the following conditions is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Atheroembolism: Atheroembolism is a condition in which atherosclerotic plaque material breaks off from the coronary arteries and travels to other parts of the body, such as the toes, causing ischemia and pain. The patient's recent percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

B. Burger's syndrome: Burger's syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the sudden onset of severe pain in the toe or foot, often after minor trauma. It is caused by a blood clot that forms in the dorsalis pedis artery and can lead to ischemia and tissue damage. However, the patient's recent percutaneous coronary intervention and history of diabetes mellitus reduce the likelihood of this diagnosis.

C. Cellulitis: Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues that can cause pain, swelling, and redness in the affected area. However, the patient's recent percutaneous coronary intervention and the presence of a photograph of the toe suggest that the pain is not related to cellulitis.

D. Diabetic foot: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus increases the likelihood of a diagnosis related to the foot. However, the sudden onset of severe pain in the right small toe, without any prior history of similar episodes, suggests that another condition may be the cause.

Answer: A. Atheroembolism."
962,"Sure! Here is the rewritten question in my style:

Question: An investigator who studies virology obtains a biopsy from the ulcer base of an active genital herpes lesion for viral culture. The cultured virions, along with herpes simplex virions of a different phenotype, are cointroduced into a human epithelial cell in vitro. The progeny viruses are found to have phenotypes that are distinct from the parent strains. Sequencing of these progeny viruses shows that most genomes have material from both parent strains. These findings are best explained by which of the following terms?

Options:

A. Complementation - This term refers to the process by which two or more genes or proteins work together to produce a functional product, but it is not relevant to the scenario described in the question.

B. Recombination - Recombination occurs when genetic material is exchanged between two organisms, resulting in the creation of new genetic combinations. In the scenario described, the progeny viruses have genomes that contain material from both parent strains, which is a classic example of recombination.

C. Phenotypic mixing - This term refers to the blending of the characteristics of two or more different organisms, but it is not applicable to the scenario described.

D. Transduction - Transduction is the process by which a virus infects a cell and transfers its genetic material to the host cell. However, the scenario described involves the introduction of virions from two different parent strains, not the transfer of genetic material from one virus to another.

Answer: B. Recombination"
963,"Question: A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency room with cough, dyspnea, and fever over the past 2 days. He also has substernal chest pain that worsens with inspiration. He recently recovered from a mild upper respiratory infection. His past medical history is notable for gout, hypertension, major depressive disorder, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. He takes allopurinol, lisinopril, buproprion, and metformin. He works as a policeman and has a 25-pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 100.8°F (38.2°C), blood pressure is 150/75 mmHg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min. On examination, he appears to be in mild distress but is cooperative and appropriately interactive. When the patient leans forward, a friction rub can be heard at the left lower sternal border. A basic metabolic panel is within normal limits. This patient’s condition is most likely caused by which of the following types of pathogens?

Options:

A. Coronavirus - This virus is known to cause respiratory symptoms such as cough and fever, but it is less likely to cause substernal chest pain.
B. Flavivirus - This virus can cause a range of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, including fever, cough, and chest pain, but it is less likely to cause a friction rub at the sternal border.
C. Paramyxovirus - This virus can cause respiratory symptoms such as cough, fever, and difficulty breathing, but it is less likely to cause substernal chest pain.
D. Picornavirus - This virus is known to cause respiratory symptoms such as cough, fever, and difficulty breathing, and can also cause chest pain, particularly when the patient is leaning forward.

Answer: D. Picornavirus.

The patient's symptoms of cough, dyspnea, fever, and substernal chest pain are consistent with a picornavirus infection. The friction rub at the left lower sternal border is also consistent with this diagnosis. While other viruses such as coronavirus, flavivirus, and paramyxovirus can also cause similar symptoms, picornavirus is the most likely cause in this case based on the patient's history and physical examination findings."
964,"Question: A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with a missed menstrual period and occasional morning nausea. Her menstrual cycles have previously been normal and on time. She has hypothyroidism resulting from Hashimoto thyroiditis diagnosed 2 years ago and is currently taking levothyroxine (50 mcg daily) and is euthyroid. She does not take any other medications, including birth control pills. At the time of presentation, her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate 68/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F). The physical examination shows slight breast engorgement and nipple hyperpigmentation. The gynecologic examination reveals cervical softening and increased mobility. The uterus is enlarged. There are no adnexal masses. The thyroid panel is as follows:

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 3.41 mU/L
Total T4 111 nmol/L
Free T4 20 pmol/L

Which of the following adjustments should be made to the patient's therapy?

A. Decrease levothyroxine dosage by 30%
B. Discontinue levothyroxine
C. Increase levothyroxine dosage by 20%–30%
D. Increase levothyroxine dosage by 5% each week until 50%

Answer: C. Increase levothyroxine dosage by 20%–30%.

Rationale: The patient's levothyroxine dosage should be increased to compensate for the hypothyroidism-related increase in thyroid hormone requirements. The patient's current dosage of 50 mcg daily may not be sufficient to maintain euthyroidism, especially given the patient's recent missed menstrual period and occasional morning nausea. Increasing the levothyroxine dosage by 20%–30% will help to restore euthyroidism and prevent further thyroid hormone deficiency."
965,"Question: An 8-year-old girl is brought to the pediatrician due to her short stature and other symptoms. Her mother notes that she has had thick, oral secretions for months, along with a chronic cough. During the exam, the pediatrician notices clubbed fingernails. The genetic test reveals a deletion of three nucleotides that code for a phenylalanine at position 508. What type of mutation is responsible for the girl's condition?

Options:
A. In-frame mutation: This type of mutation occurs when a nucleotide is inserted or deleted from the genetic code, resulting in a change in the reading frame of the genetic sequence. In this case, the deletion of three nucleotides codes for a phenylalanine at position 508, which is not a neutral mutation.
B. Nonsense mutation: This type of mutation occurs when a stop codon is reached prematurely, causing the production of a truncated protein. In this case, the deletion of three nucleotides results in a premature stop codon, which would lead to the production of a truncated protein.
C. Triplet expansion: This type of mutation occurs when an extra nucleotide is inserted into the genetic sequence, leading to an increase in the number of codons. In this case, the deletion of three nucleotides would result in an expansion of three codons.
D. Silent mutation: This type of mutation occurs when a nucleotide is changed, but the change does not alter the protein sequence. In this case, the deletion of three nucleotides would not result in a change in the protein sequence.

Answer: A. In-frame mutation."
966,"Question: A thymidine kinase-deficient varicella-zoster virus (VZV) strain has been isolated from a retirement home, where many elderly individuals have been infected and are experiencing shingles. Which antiviral agent would be the most effective in treating this population?

Options:
A. Acyclovir: A nucleoside analogue that is commonly used to treat VZV infections, including shingles. However, its effectiveness against thymidine kinase-deficient VZV strains is uncertain.
B. Famciclovir: An acyclic nucleoside phosphonate that is also used to treat VZV infections, including shingles. It has been shown to be effective against both wild-type and thymidine kinase-deficient VZV strains.
C. Cidofovir: A nucleotide inhibitor that has been shown to be effective against VZV in vitro and in vivo. It has also been used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in immunocompromised individuals.
D. Amantadine: An antiviral drug that is primarily used to treat influenza A and B viruses. It has been shown to have some activity against herpesviruses, including VZV, but its effectiveness against thymidine kinase-deficient VZV strains is unknown.

Answer: C. Cidofovir. While acyclovir and famciclovir are commonly used to treat VZV infections, including shingles, their effectiveness against thymidine kinase-deficient VZV strains is uncertain. Famciclovir has been shown to be effective against both wild-type and thymidine kinase-deficient VZV strains, but cidofovir has been specifically shown to be effective against VZV in vitro and in vivo, including against thymidine kinase-deficient strains. Amantadine has been shown to have some activity against herpesviruses, but its effectiveness against thymidine kinase-deficient VZV strains is unknown."
967,"Question: An at-home recreational drug screening test kit is currently being developed. They consult you for assistance with determining an ideal cut-off point for the level of the serum marker in the test kit. This cut-off point will determine what level of serum marker is associated with a positive or negative test, with serum marker levels greater than the cut-off point indicative of a positive test and vice-versa. The cut-off level is initially set at 4 mg/uL, which is associated with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 97%. How will the sensitivity and specificity of the test change if the cut-off level is raised to 6 mg/uL?

A. Sensitivity: The sensitivity of the test will decrease if the cut-off level is raised to 6 mg/uL. With a higher cut-off point, more individuals with lower levels of the serum marker will be classified as negative, resulting in a decrease in sensitivity.

B. Specificity: The specificity of the test will decrease if the cut-off level is raised to 6 mg/uL. With a higher cut-off point, more individuals with true positive results will be misclassified as negative, resulting in a decrease in specificity.

C. Sensitivity: The sensitivity of the test will decrease if the cut-off level is raised to 6 mg/uL. With a higher cut-off point, more individuals with lower levels of the serum marker will be classified as negative, resulting in a decrease in sensitivity.

D. Specificity: The specificity of the test will increase if the cut-off level is raised to 6 mg/uL. With a higher cut-off point, fewer individuals with true positive results will be misclassified as negative, resulting in an increase in specificity.

Answer: C. Sensitivity decreases, specificity increases"
968,"Question: A 19-year-old woman, accompanied by her parents, presents to the emergency department after a one-week history of abnormal behavior, delusions, and unusual aggression. She is not responding verbally and has a fever. What is the best first step in her management?

Options:
A. Intravenous hydration - Intravenous hydration may be necessary to treat dehydration, but it is not the best first step in managing this patient's condition.
B. Paracetamol - Paracetamol may help manage fever, but it is not the best option for this patient's presentation.
C. Stop risperidone - Stopping the risperidone medication may be necessary if the patient is experiencing adverse effects from the medication, but it is the best option for this patient's management.
D. Switch risperidone to clozapine - Switching the medication to clozapine may be considered, but it is not the best option for this patient's management.

Answer: C. Stop risperidone - Stopping the risperidone medication is the best first step in managing this patient's condition, as it may be contributing to her delusions and aggression."
969,"Question: The 18-year-old woman visits her primary care physician for a physical examination before starting school. She discloses that she has no medical history, is on her school's volleyball team, exercises daily, and does not use drugs or smoke cigarettes. During the physical examination, the physician notices bruising around the patient's neck and burn marks on her back and thighs. The patient explains that these marks are the result of her sexual activities. She states that she requires specific acts, such as hitting or choking, to become aroused. The physician learns that the patient lives with her boyfriend, who is her committed partner, and that she is currently monogamous with him. The patient is studying to become a lawyer and works in a coffee shop. Based on this information, the most likely diagnosis is:

A. Sexual masochism.

Explanation: The patient's disclosure of requiring specific acts, such as hitting or choking, to become aroused, is a classic symptom of sexual masochism. This paraphilic disorder is characterized by deriving sexual pleasure from activities that involve suffering or humiliation, and the patient's description fits this criteria. While the other options could potentially be considered, the patient's history and physical examination findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of sexual masochism."
970,"Question: A 45-year-old man presents to the office with complaints of facial puffiness and mild swelling in his lower back. He denies chest pain, blood in the urine, or fever. He was recently diagnosed with colon cancer. The vital signs include a blood pressure of 122/78 mm Hg, a pulse of 76/min, a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), and a respiratory rate of 10/min. On physical examination, there is mild facial puffiness that is pitting in nature and presacral edema. His other systemic findings are within normal limits.

Urinalysis shows:
pH 6.2
Color light yellow
RBC none
WBC 3–4/HPF
Protein 4+
Cast oval fat bodies
Glucose absent

Ketone absent
Nitrite absent
24 hours urine protein excretion 4.8 g
A renal biopsy is ordered and diffuse capillary and basement membrane thickening is noted. Which of the following findings is expected to be present if an electron microscopy of the biopsy sample is performed?

C. Spike and dome appearance

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with nephrotic syndrome, a condition characterized by the loss of large amounts of protein in the urine. The urinalysis results show proteinuria, which is the presence of protein in the urine, and the renal biopsy confirms the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome.

An electron microscopy of the biopsy sample is expected to reveal the following findings:

* Spike and dome appearance: This is a characteristic feature of membranous nephropathy, a type of nephrotic syndrome caused by damage to the glomerular basement membrane. The spike and dome appearance refers to the abnormal shape of the foot processes, which are small projections on the surface of the glomerular cells that filter waste products from the blood. In membranous nephropathy, the foot processes are abnormally shaped and can appear as spikes or domes under the electron microscope.

Therefore, the answer is (C) Spike and dome appearance."
971,"Question: A 30-year-old woman presents to the clinic with complaints of fever, joint pain, and a rash on her lower extremities. She has a history of intravenous drug use. Upon physical examination, palpable petechiae and purpura are noted on her lower extremities. Laboratory results reveal a negative antinuclear antibody, positive rheumatoid factor, and positive serum cryoglobulins. Which of the following underlying conditions is responsible for these findings?

Options:

A. Hepatitis B infection
B. Hepatitis C infection
C. HIV infection
D. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

Answer: B. Hepatitis C infection

Rationale: The patient's laboratory results, including the presence of positive serum cryoglobulins, are consistent with hepatitis C infection. Cryoglobulins are proteins that are produced in response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and can cause the formation of immune complexes in the blood, leading to the development of palpable petechiae and purpura on the lower extremities. The patient's history of intravenous drug use also increases the likelihood of HCV infection, as sharing needles can be a common mode of transmission. Hepatitis B and HIV infections are less likely causes of these findings, as they typically do not cause palpable purpura or petechiae. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is also an unlikely cause, as it is an autoimmune disorder that typically affects multiple organ systems and does not typically present with skin manifestations such as purpura and petechiae."
972,"Question: A 32-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after experiencing convulsions in the office. She has no prior history of seizures and recovers by the time she arrives at the emergency department. Over the past two days, she has also experienced insomnia, abdominal pain, and dark urine. Her medical history includes asthma, but she has never experienced these symptoms before. She smokes one pack of cigarettes daily, drinks a glass of wine with dinner every night, and is taking oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Upon presentation, her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 140/98 mmHg, pulse is 112/min, and respirations are 11/min. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to be defective in this patient?

A. Aminolevulinate synthase
B. Ferrochelatase
C. Porphobilinogen deaminase
D. Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase

Answer: C. Porphobilinogen deaminase

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of insomnia, abdominal pain, and dark urine are consistent with a porphyrinogenic disorder, which is caused by a deficiency in one of the enzymes involved in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Porphobilinogen deaminase is the most likely enzyme to be defective in this patient, as it is responsible for the conversion of porphobilinogen to deaminoporhobilinogen, a critical step in the heme biosynthesis pathway. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption may also contribute to the development of this disorder by increasing the oxidative stress and inflammation in the body."
973,"Question: A 67-year-old man presents with a severely painful tongue lesion, accompanied by a recent headache on the left side of his head that occasionally radiates to his right eye. He has a history of hypertension and recurrent migraines. What is the next best step in managing this patient?

Options:
A. CT scan - While a CT scan may help identify the cause of the patient's symptoms, it may not be the next best step in managing his condition. The patient's history of hypertension and recurrent migraines suggests that he may have a vascular etiology for his symptoms, which can be managed with high-dose systemic corticosteroids.

B. Lysis therapy - Lysis therapy is not a recommended treatment for vascular lesions such as the one described in the patient's presentation. It is more likely to be effective in treating intracranial lesions caused by infection or inflammation.

C. High-dose systemic corticosteroids - The patient's history of hypertension and recurrent migraines suggests that he may have a vascular etiology for his symptoms, which can be managed with high-dose systemic corticosteroids. These medications can help reduce inflammation and swelling in the affected vessel, which may alleviate the patient's symptoms.

D. Paracetamol - While paracetamol may provide some relief for mild to moderate pain, it is not a suitable treatment for the patient's severely painful tongue lesion.

Answer: C. High-dose systemic corticosteroids."
974,"Question: A 66-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a wellness exam. She noticed mild spotting a few days prior to presentation. Her last menstrual period was when she was 53 years of age, and she denies any trauma to the area. She is sexually active with one male partner and does not use condoms. Medical history is significant for type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She is currently taking metformin and lisinopril. Her last pap smear was normal. She is 5 ft 5 in (165.1 cm), weighs 185 lbs (84 kg), and BMI is 30.8 kg/m2. Her blood pressure is 115/70 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 15/min. Pelvic examination demonstrates a normal sized uterus with no adnexal masses. There are no vulvar, vaginal, or cervical lesions. Stool testing for blood is negative and an endometrial biopsy is performed, which demonstrates simple endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

A. Anastrozole: Anastrozole is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is used to treat hormone-sensitive early-stage breast cancer. It is not the best next step in management for the patient's symptoms, as it is not indicated for the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia.

B. Estrogen-progestin contraceptives: Estrogen-progestin contraceptives, such as the pill or patch, can help to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer by thinning the endometrium and reducing the amount of estrogen available for stimulating endometrial growth. However, these medications are not the best next step in management for the patient's symptoms, as they are not specifically approved for the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia.

C. Megestrol acetate: Megestrol acetate is a progestin that is used to treat endometrial hyperplasia. It works by reducing the growth of the endometrium and can help to improve symptoms such as abnormal bleeding. Therefore, megestrol acetate is the best next step in management for the patient's symptoms.

D. Nafarelin: Nafarelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist that is used to treat endometrial hyperplasia. It works by reducing the growth of the endometrium and can help to improve symptoms such as abnormal bleeding. However, nafarelin is not the best next step in management for the patient's symptoms, as it is not specifically approved for the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia.

Answer: C. Megestrol acetate"
975,"Question: A 24-year-old man visits his primary care physician for a routine follow-up appointment for his asthma. He is currently taking albuterol, corticosteroids, and salmeterol via inhalation, and has been compliant with his medication regimen. However, he still experiences episodic shortness of breath and wheezing. Despite improvements in peak expiratory flow (PEF) since his last visit, the PEF remains below predicted values based on his age, gender, and height. To enhance his treatment, montelukast is added to his regimen. What is the mechanism of action of this medication?

A. Montelukast prevents the release of inflammatory substances from mast cells.
B. Montelukast binds to IgE molecules.
C. Montelukast blocks receptors for certain arachidonic acid metabolites.
D. Montelukast inhibits the production of inflammatory leukotrienes.

Answer: C. Montelukast blocks receptors for certain arachidonic acid metabolites. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, which means it binds to the receptors on airway cells that are responsible for mediating the inflammatory effects of leukotrienes. By blocking these receptors, montelukast reduces the inflammation and constriction of airways that occur in asthma, leading to improved lung function and reduced symptoms."
976,"Question: A 20-year-old premedical student traveling abroad for a global health service semester experiences palpitations, which she initially dismissed as a side effect of working too hard. However, the frequency of these episodes has increased. She also experiences headaches and episodes of sweating, but notes that many members of her family have migraines. Upon presentation to the local clinic, her temperature is 99°F (37°C), blood pressure is 170/120 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 20/min. Other laboratory testing is not available. The doctor provides an older medication that he says does not bind to the relevant receptor but instead blocks an upstream process. The drug provided most likely has which of the following mechanisms of action?

Options:

A. Cleavage of vesicular SNAP proteins
B. Inhibition of metabolite conversion
C. Inhibition of vesicular transporters
D. Replacement of vesicular contents

Answer: B. Inhibition of metabolite conversion

Explanation:

The medication provided by the doctor is an older drug that does not bind to the relevant receptor but instead blocks an upstream process. This suggests that the drug acts by inhibiting the conversion of a metabolite, rather than directly interacting with a receptor. Inhibition of metabolite conversion is a common mechanism of action for drugs that target upstream processes in the body. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
977,"Question: A 56-year-old woman presents with a 5-day history of progressively worsening shortness of breath and bilateral pleuritic chest pain, along with associated fatigue, low-grade fever, and night sweats. Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 106/min, respiratory rate is 26/min, and blood pressure is 136/88 mm Hg. On physical examination, she is diaphoretic and in mild respiratory distress. Cardiac auscultation reveals a faint 2/6 systolic murmur best heard over the lower left sternal border. Her neck veins are distended, and abdominal examination shows significant hepatomegaly. Echocardiography is performed and results are shown below:

Echocardiography Results:

Left ventricular ejection fraction: 40%
Left atrial size: 40 mm
Left ventricular dimensions:

* Diameter: 45 mm
* Wall thickness: 10 mm

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's clinical presentation?

A. Infective endocarditis
B. Myocardial infarction
C. Rheumatic fever
D. Small cell lung cancer

Answer: A. Infective endocarditis

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening shortness of breath and bilateral pleuritic chest pain, along with the finding of a faint 2/6 systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation, are consistent with infective endocarditis. The patient's age and history of recent illness also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. Infective endocarditis is a bacterial infection of the heart valves, which can cause symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever. Myocardial infarction, rheumatic fever, and small cell lung cancer are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms based on the presented echocardiography results and clinical presentation."
978,"Question: A 55-year-old IV drug user presents to the emergency department with four days of severe pain in his right ankle. The patient is lethargic and unable to provide any medical history. Vitals are as follows: HR 110, T 101.5, RR 20, BP 100/60. Physical exam reveals track marks in the patient's toes and a swollen, erythematous right ankle. Moving the right foot causes extreme pain (10/10). A radiograph does not show any fractures. A Gram stain of the joint fluid aspirate shows purple cocci in clusters. The fluid is yellow, opaque, and contains over 70,000 cells/mm^3 (80% neutrophils). What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Salmonella infectious arthritis
B. Staphylococcus infectious arthritis
C. Borrelia infectious arthritis
D. Osteoarthritis

Answer: B. Staphylococcus infectious arthritis

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of severe pain and swelling in the right ankle, along with the presence of purple cocci in clusters in the joint fluid aspirate, are highly suggestive of a Staphylococcus aureus infection, commonly known as staphylococcal infectious arthritis. The patient's history of IV drug use also increases the likelihood of a bacterial infection. Salmonella, Borrelia, and osteoarthritis are less likely causes based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings."
979,"Question: A 55-year-old construction worker falls off a 2-story scaffolding and injures his back. His coworkers bring him to the urgent care clinic within 30 minutes of the fall. He complains of left lower-limb weakness and loss of sensation in the right lower limb. He does not have any past medical history. His vital signs are stable. A neurologic examination reveals a total loss of motor function when testing left knee extension, along with the left-sided loss of light touch sensation from the mid-thigh and below. There is a right-sided loss of pin-prick sensation of the lateral leg and entire foot. At this time of acute injury, what other finding is most likely to be found in this patient?

A. Left-sided numbness at the level of the lesion: The patient's neurological examination reveals a total loss of motor function when testing left knee extension, which suggests that the injury may have caused a significant lesion in the spinal cord or nerve root, leading to numbness or loss of sensation in the left lower limb. Therefore, left-sided numbness at the level of the lesion is the most likely finding in this patient.

B. Intact voluntary anal contraction: This option is incorrect because the patient's neurological examination does not reveal any signs of intact voluntary anal contraction, which suggests that the injury has affected the patient's spinal cord or nerve roots above the level of the anal sphincter.

C. Right-sided loss of proprioception and vibration sensation: This option is incorrect because the patient's neurological examination reveals a right-sided loss of pin-prick sensation of the lateral leg and entire foot, which suggests that the injury may have affected the patient's nerve roots or spinal cord on the right side. However, there is no mention of a left-sided loss of proprioception and vibration sensation in the patient's examination.

D. Left-sided spastic paralysis below the lesion: This option is incorrect because the patient's neurological examination does not reveal any signs of left-sided spastic paralysis below the level of the lesion. Instead, the patient experiences left lower-limb weakness and loss of sensation in the right lower limb, which suggests that the injury may have affected the patient's spinal cord or nerve roots above the level of the lesion."
980,"Question: A 25-year-old man is scheduled for an orthopedic surgery. His routine preoperative laboratory tests are within normal limits. An urticarial reaction occurs when a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent is injected for muscle relaxation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's lungs are manually ventilated with 100% O2 by bag and mask and then through an endotracheal tube. After a few minutes, edema of the face and neck rapidly ensues and giant hives appear over most of his body. Which of the following neuromuscular blocking agents was most likely used in this operation?

Options:
A. Succinylcholine: Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, which means it can cause an allergic reaction, but it is unlikely to cause an urticarial reaction like the one described in the scenario.
B. Neostigmine: Neostigmine is a reversible non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, which means it can cause an allergic reaction, and the urticarial reaction described in the scenario is consistent with this option.
C. D-tubocurarine: D-tubocurarine is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent that can cause an allergic reaction, and the symptoms described in the scenario are consistent with this option.
D. Ketamine: Ketamine is an anesthetic agent that can cause an allergic reaction, but it is unlikely to cause an urticarial reaction like the one described in the scenario.

Answer: C. D-tubocurarine."
981,"Question: An 11-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with sudden pain. The patient's parents state the child suddenly felt pain in his hands an hour ago. He has not eaten anything new lately. He did play football earlier this morning and admits to being tackled forcefully multiple times. The child is doing well in school and is proud that he has a new girlfriend. The child has a past medical history of obesity and is not currently on any medications. His temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. On physical exam of the patient's extremities, there was painful and symmetrical swelling of his hands and feet but no rashes were present. The patient is started on analgesics. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?

Options:
A. Altered red blood cell morphology - The patient's symptoms of sudden pain in his hands and feet, along with the swelling observed on physical exam, are consistent with a possible diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome. This condition occurs when there is increased pressure within a compartment of the body, causing damage to the surrounding tissues and organs. The most likely cause of this compression is the recent trauma sustained by the patient during the football game, which may have caused direct injury to the muscles and nerves in the affected limbs.

B. Benign edema secondary to trauma - While benign edema can occur as a result of trauma, the patient's symptoms of sudden pain and swelling in his hands and feet are more consistent with acute compartment syndrome than benign edema.

C. Sexually transmitted infection - There is no mention of any symptoms suggestive of a sexually transmitted infection, such as genital itching, burning during urination, or unusual discharge.

D. Viral infection - The patient's symptoms of sudden pain and swelling in his hands and feet do not suggest a viral infection, as these symptoms are not typically associated with viral illnesses.

Answer: A. Altered red blood cell morphology"
982,"Question: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother due to a 12-hour history of abdominal pain and dark urine. Three days ago, he developed a cough, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. Examination shows conjunctival pallor, scleral icterus, and mild splenomegaly. A peripheral blood smear shows small round inclusions within erythrocytes and several erythrocytes with semicircular indentations. The underlying cause of this patient's condition is most likely to also affect which of the following processes?

Options:

A. Biosynthesis of glutathione - This process is not related to the patient's symptoms or the findings on examination. Glutathione is an antioxidant that plays a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative damage, but it is not involved in the production of red blood cells or the metabolism of hemoglobin.

B. Generation of superoxide - The peripheral blood smear shows small round inclusions within erythrocytes, which are indicative of hemolytic anemia. Hemolysis is the breakdown of red blood cells, which can be caused by various factors, including the generation of superoxide. Superoxide is a reactive oxygen species that can damage red blood cells and lead to their breakdown.

C. Anchoring proteins to cell surface - This option is unrelated to the patient's symptoms or findings on examination. Anchoring proteins are important for the structure and function of red blood cells, but they are not involved in the production or metabolism of hemoglobin.

D. Function of myeloperoxidase - Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme that is involved in the oxidative burst of neutrophils, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms or findings on examination. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a hemolytic anemia, which is caused by the breakdown of red blood cells.

Answer: B. Generation of superoxide"
983,"Question: A 48-year-old woman presents to her physician with a 6-month history of excessive fatigue and a 1-month history of progressively increasing generalized pruritus. She has a known history of hypothyroidism, for which she receives thyroid replacement therapy. Physical examination reveals jaundice, and serum studies show a direct bilirubin concentration of 2.9 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase activity of 580 U/L, and elevated titers of antimitochondrial antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. What is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?

A. Uncontrolled accumulation of fat in the liver
B. Growth of a tumor in the ampulla of Vater
C. Damage to the tiny bile ducts within the liver
D. Inflammation and scarring of the biliary tree

Answer: C. Damage to the tiny bile ducts within the liver

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of fatigue and pruritus, along with the elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels, suggest that there is a problem with the liver's ability to process and transport bilirubin. The presence of antimitochondrial antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies also supports this diagnosis, as these antibodies are commonly seen in patients with autoimmune hepatitis, a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to the liver's bile ducts. Option A is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has an idiopathic accumulation of fat in the liver. Option B is unlikely, as there is no evidence of a tumor in the ampulla of Vater. Option D is also unlikely, as inflammation and scarring of the biliary tree is a later stage of liver disease and is not seen in the patient's serum studies."
984,"Question: A 57-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of severe back and left leg pain. He describes the pain as sudden onset, severe, and worsened by movement. The patient denies any other symptoms such as bowel or urinary incontinence, saddle anesthesia, weight loss, or weakness. He has a history of smoking and a positive family history of osteoporosis. On physical examination, there is decreased sensation at the left knee, decreased patellar reflex, and a positive straight leg test. Palpation of the lower back reveals diffuse tenderness. What is the most likely etiology for this patient's pain?

A. Disc herniation at the L3/L4 vertebra - The patient's symptoms of sudden onset, severe pain, and worsening with movement are consistent with a disc herniation at the L3/L4 vertebra. The patient's history of smoking and family history of osteoporosis also increase the likelihood of a degenerative condition such as a herniated disc.

B. Disc herniation at the L4/L5 vertebra - Although the patient's symptoms could be attributed to a herniation at the L4/L5 vertebra, the absence of vertebral step-offs on physical examination suggests that this is less likely.

C. Spinal metastasis from lung cancer - Although the patient has a history of smoking, the absence of other symptoms such as weight loss, fever, or night sweats makes it less likely that the pain is caused by a spinal metastasis.

D. Vertebral compression fracture - The patient's age and history of smoking increase the likelihood of osteoporosis, which can lead to vertebral compression fractures. However, the patient's physical examination findings do not suggest this as the most likely cause of their pain."
985,"Question: A 67-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of retrosternal chest pressure and shortness of breath that started while walking to work, lasting for 4 hours with minimal improvement with rest. He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and smokes one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. His vital signs show a pulse of 95/min. Laboratory tests reveal a normal troponin concentration, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) shows no abnormalities. Based on this information, which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms?

A. Coronary artery occlusion due to a transient increase in vascular tone
B. Stable atherosclerotic plaque with 85% coronary artery occlusion
C. Disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque with a non-occlusive coronary artery thrombus
D. Atherosclerotic plaque thrombus with complete coronary artery occlusion

Answer: C. Disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque with a non-occlusive coronary artery thrombus.

Rationale: The patient's symptoms of retrosternal chest pressure and shortness of breath, which have persisted for 4 hours despite rest, suggest that the underlying cause is likely related to a disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque in a non-occlusive coronary artery. This is supported by the patient's history of smoking and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which increase the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. The normal troponin concentration on laboratory tests suggests that there is no evidence of myocardial infarction or coronary artery occlusion, which rules out options A and D. Option B is also unlikely, as there is no evidence of a stable atherosclerotic plaque with 85% coronary artery occlusion. Option A is not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, as there is no evidence of a transient increase in vascular tone causing coronary artery occlusion."
986,"Question: A 55-year-old man presents with fever, chills, fatigue, cough, sore throat, and breathlessness for the past 7 days. He describes the cough as productive and says he is fatigued all the time. He says he is a farmer with daily contact with rabbits, horses, sheep, pigeons, and chickens and reports cleaning the barn 3 days before his symptoms started. The patient denies any history of tick bites. Past medical history is irrelevant. His temperature is 39.4°C (103.0°F), pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 26/min. On physical examination, there are decreased breath sounds on the right side. A large tender node is palpable in the right axilla. A chest radiograph reveals multiple homogenous opacities in the lower lobe of the right lung and a right-sided pleural effusion. Gram staining of a sputum sample is negative for any organism. Serology tests are negative. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism for this patient's condition?

A. Francisella tularensis: Based on the patient's exposure to animals and the presence of a right-sided pleural effusion, the most likely causative organism for this patient's condition is Francisella tularensis, also known as tularemia. This bacterium is commonly found in animals and can cause pneumonia and pleural effusions in humans.

B. Bacillus anthracis: While the patient's exposure to animals increases the likelihood of Bacillus anthracis infection, the absence of any history of tick bites and the negative serology tests rule out this organism as the causative agent.

C. Staphylococcus aureus: Staphylococcus aureus can cause pneumonia and pleural effusions, but the absence of any signs of bacterial infection in the sputum sample and the presence of decreased breath sounds on the right side suggest that this organism is not the most likely cause of the patient's condition.

D. Yersinia pestis: Yersinia pestis is a bacterium that can cause pneumonia and pleural effusions, but the patient's lack of exposure to ticks and the absence of any signs of bacterial infection in the sputum sample make it an unlikely causative agent."
987,"Question: A 15-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency department by his father after falling into a frozen lake during ice fishing. He was submerged in the icy water for less than a minute before his father rescued him. Upon arrival, the boy's clothes are still soaked and he looks frightened. His body temperature is 36.2°C (97.1°F), pulse is 102 beats per minute, blood pressure is 133/88 mmHg. Which bodily function primarily maintains this patient's core temperature?

A. Voluntary muscle contractions
B. Hair follicle contractions
C. Thyroid gland inhibition
D. Brown adipose tissue activation

Answer: A. Voluntary muscle contractions"
988,"Question: A 37-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with dysphagia. He notes that his symptoms began several weeks ago and have worsened over time. He now has trouble swallowing solids and liquids. He denies any other symptoms. He has no significant past medical history. Travel history reveals a recent trip to South America but no other travel outside the United States. His temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 120/81 mmHg, pulse is 99/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. HEENT exam is unremarkable. He has no palpable masses in his abdomen. What is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Barium swallow: Barium swallow is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's dysphagia. Barium swallow is a diagnostic test that uses a non-toxic, radioopaque substance to visualize the esophageal mucosa and evaluate for any abnormalities, such as stricture or tumors. This test can help identify the underlying cause of the patient's dysphagia and guide further management.

B. Endoscopy: Endoscopy is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's dysphagia. While endoscopy can be used to evaluate the esophageal mucosa and diagnose conditions such as esophagitis or esophageal cancer, it is not necessary in this case as the patient's symptoms are primarily related to difficulty swallowing. Barium swallow is a more specific test for evaluating swallowing function.

C. Myotomy: Myotomy is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's dysphagia. Myotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting the muscles in the esophagus to improve swallowing function. However, this procedure is typically reserved for patients with severe dysphagia caused by structural abnormalities, such as esophageal webs or strictures, and is not necessary in this case.

D. Nifurtimox: Nifurtimox is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's dysphagia. Nifurtimox is an antiparasitic drug that is used to treat Chagas disease, but it is not relevant to the patient's dysphagia.

Answer: A. Barium swallow"
989,"Sure, here is the rewritten question in my own style:

Question: A 20-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of severe malaise, fevers, and sore throat for the past 7 days. He also has had episodes of nausea and vomiting during this period. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. There is no family history of liver disease. His blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 102/min, and respiratory rate is 20/min. On physical examination, he appears ill with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. His tonsils are erythematous and enlarged. There is no jaundice and he is mildly dehydrated. Abdominal examination demonstrates splenomegaly. The laboratory findings are shown below:

Hemoglobin: 15 g/dL
Platelet count: 95,000/mm³
Leukocytes: 13,500/mm³
Neutrophils: 50%
Atypical lymphocytes: 34%
AST: 232 U/L
ALT: 312 U/L
ALP: 120 U/L
GGT: 35 U/L
Total bilirubin: 1.2 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin: 0.2 mg/dL
PT: 12 seconds

The serologic tests for hepatitis A, B, and C, CMV, and leptospirosis are negative. Serology for both serum IgM and IgG antibodies for EBV capsid antigen is positive, but the heterophile antibody test is negative. What is the most likely reason for the negative heterophile test?

B. False negative

Explanation: The patient's positive serology for EBV capsid antigen and negative heterophile antibody test suggest that the patient has developed an EBV infection. Heterophile antibodies are typically present in the blood during the early stages of EBV infection, but they may not always be detected in the blood of all patients. In this case, the patient's negative heterophile test result is likely due to the early stage of the infection."
990,"Question: A 49-year-old woman presents with a 1-year history of alternating bloating and constipation, followed by diarrhea. She has a history of competitive swimming and has stopped training due to finger pain and discoloration. She drinks one to two glasses of wine daily. On examination, her hands and fingers are swollen and have wax-like thickening of the skin, with dilated blood vessels at the tips. Which of the following is most likely to be revealed by further evaluation?

A. Bilateral pupillary constriction
B. Outpouchings of the sigmoid colon
C. Villous atrophy in the duodenum
D. Calcium deposits in the skin

Answer: D. Calcium deposits in the skin.

The woman's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a condition known as Raynaud's phenomenon, which is characterized by vasospasm in the fingers and toes in response to cold temperatures. Calcium deposits in the skin are a common finding in Raynaud's phenomenon, and are likely to be revealed by further evaluation such as imaging studies or biopsy. Bilateral pupillary constriction, outpouchings of the sigmoid colon, and villous atrophy in the duodenum are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or findings."
991,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a fever and altered mental status. His wife found him in his chair at home, and he was unable to respond coherently to her questions. He has a history of pancreatitis and alcohol abuse, and is currently in rehabilitation. His vital signs are: temperature 103°F (39.4°C), blood pressure 127/68 mmHg, pulse 120/min, respirations 12/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Laboratory results show:

Serum: Na+ 139 mEq/L, Cl- 100 mEq/L, K+ 4.3 mEq/L, HCO3- 25 mEq/L, BUN 29 mg/dL, Glucose 99 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, Ca2+ 5.2 mg/dL, AST 12 U/L, ALT 10 U/L, 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol 50 nmol/L. Physical exam reveals a diffusely distended and tender abdomen. Which of the following symptoms is the most likely to be occurring in this patient secondary to his laboratory abnormalities?

A. Asymptomatic - This is the most likely option as the patient has no reported symptoms related to his laboratory abnormalities.
B. Laryngospasm - This is not a likely symptom for the patient's laboratory abnormalities.
C. Paresthesias - This is not a likely symptom for the patient's laboratory abnormalities.
D. QT prolongation - This is not a likely symptom for the patient's laboratory abnormalities."
992,"Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother with fever and a rash. The patient’s mother reports that his symptoms started 1 week ago with the sudden onset of fever and a runny nose, which resolved over the next 3 days. Then, 4 days later, she noticed a rash on his face, which, after a day, spread to his neck, torso, and extremities. The patient denies any pruritus or pain associated with the rash. No recent history of sore throat, chills, or upper respiratory infection. The patient has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. The vital signs include: temperature 37.2°C (99.9°F) and pulse 88/min. On physical examination, there is a maculopapular rash on his face, torso, and extremities, which spares the palms and soles. The appearance of the rash is shown in the exhibit (see image below). Which of the following would most likely confirm the diagnosis in this patient?

A. Assay for IgM and IgG against measles virus
B. Serology for human herpesvirus-6 IgM antibodies
C. ELISA for IgG antibodies against Rubella virus
D. ELISA for parvovirus B-19 IgM and IgG antibodies

Answer: D. ELISA for parvovirus B-19 IgM and IgG antibodies

The maculopapular rash on the patient's face, torso, and extremities, along with the sudden onset and rapid spread of the rash, are highly suggestive of parvovirus B-19 infection. While measles, rubella, and human herpesvirus-6 can also cause rashes, they typically have different clinical presentations and epidemiological features. Parvovirus B-19 is a common cause of fifth disease, which is characterized by a maculopapular rash that typically appears on the face, trunk, and extremities, and spares the palms and soles. The IgM antibodies against parvovirus B-19 are typically detectable in the blood within 2-3 weeks after infection, and the IgG antibodies may take longer to develop. Therefore, an ELISA for parvovirus B-19 IgM and IgG antibodies would be the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis in this patient."
993,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 27-year-old man visits his physician with a 4-month history of recurring headaches, palpitations, and sweating. He was adopted as a baby and doesn't know his biological parents. His pulse is 103 beats per minute and blood pressure is 160/105 mmHg. During physical examination, soft, yellow papules are found on the tip of his tongue, and a 2-cm firm nodule is discovered on his thyroid gland. His upper extremities are long and slender, and his elbows and knees can be easily hyperextended. What gene mutation is most likely responsible for this patient's condition?

Options:
A. RET
B. FBN1
C. TSC2
D. COL5A1

Answer: A. RET"
994,"Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician due to recurrent nosebleeds and fatigue for the past 2 months. He also frequently complains of headaches. The patient has met all motoric milestones for his age but doesn't like to run due to leg pain. He is at the 40th percentile for both height and weight. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 125/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure in the right arm is 130/85 mm Hg. A grade 2/6 systolic murmur is heard in the left paravertebral region. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?

A. Inferior rib notching
B. Pulmonary valve stenosis
C. Left-axis deviation on ECG
D. Delayed pulse in lower extremities

Answer: D. Delayed pulse in lower extremities

Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent nosebleeds and fatigue, along with their frequent complaints of headaches, suggest that there may be a cardiovascular or circulatory issue underlying their symptoms. The delayed pulse in the lower extremities is a common finding in patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly those with cyanotic congenital heart defects. Therefore, this option is the most likely outcome of further evaluation."
995,"Question: A 72-year-old male with a past medical history of aortic stenosis and hypertension presents to the emergency department complaining of weakness for the past 3 weeks. He also reports lightheadedness, pallor, and blood-streaked stools. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is in no acute distress. Laboratory workup reveals anemia and fecal occult blood test is positive for bleeding. After ruling out upper GI bleeding with endoscopy, a colonoscopy is performed, and it is unremarkable. What is the next step in localizing a lower GI bleed in this patient?

A. Nasogastric tube lavage
B. Technetium-99 labelled erythrocyte scintigraphy
C. Ultrasound of the abdomen
D. CT of the abdomen

Answer: B. Technetium-99 labelled erythrocyte scintigraphy

Rationale: Technetium-99 labelled erythrocyte scintigraphy is a specific imaging technique that can help localize a lower GI bleed by visualizing the distribution of radioactive red blood cells in the gastrointestinal tract. This test can help identify the site of bleeding and guide further interventions. Nasogastric tube lavage, ultrasound of the abdomen, and CT of the abdomen are not as specific for localizing a lower GI bleed and may not provide the same level of detail as Technetium-99 labelled erythrocyte scintigraphy."
996,"Question: A 14-year-old Asian girl is brought to the physician due to a 6-week history of fatigue, weight loss, and recurrent episodes of pain in her left wrist and right knee. Which of the following findings is most likely to be revealed by further evaluation of this patient?

Options:
A. Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies
B. Positive monospot test
C. Anti-dsDNA antibodies
D. Elevated serum IgA levels

Answer: C. Anti-dsDNA antibodies

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient's fatigue, weight loss, and recurrent joint pain are classic symptoms of SLE, and the presence of diffuse lymphadenopathy and oral ulcers also support this diagnosis. The patient's family history of rheumatoid arthritis also increases the likelihood of an autoimmune disorder. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are commonly used as a diagnostic marker for SLE, and their presence in the patient's bloodwork suggests that she may have this condition. The other options are less likely to be revealed by further evaluation, as they are not as closely associated with SLE."
997,"Sure, here's the rewritten question in my style:

Question: A 54-year-old man presents to the emergency department after an episode of loss of consciousness lasting 3 minutes. He has experienced weakness in his left arm and leg, slurred speech, and a fever that has persisted for 10 days. He has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is currently taking medications for these conditions. On examination, he shows multiple petechiae on his trunk and painless macules on both palms. A new grade 3/6 systolic murmur is heard at the apex, and there is left facial droop. His muscle strength is reduced in his left upper and lower extremities, and his deep tendon reflexes are abnormal. Fundoscopic examination reveals retinal hemorrhages with white centers. Laboratory tests show abnormalities in his electrolyte levels and urinalysis. Based on these findings, which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?

A. Septic emboli
B. Temporal encephalitis
C. Ruptured saccular aneurysm
D. Contiguous spread of infection

Answer: C. Septic emboli"
998,"Question: A previously healthy 30-year-old woman presents to the physician with a 3-month history of progressive shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, constipation, and fatigue. She has not traveled recently or been exposed to any sick contacts. Physical examination reveals injected conjunctivae and tender, erythematous nodules on both shins. Chest x-ray is unremarkable. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be present in this patient?

Options:
A. Positive interferon-gamma release assay - This test measures the immune system's response to infection and is often used to diagnose autoimmune disorders. However, in this patient's case, the symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with an infectious process, such as tuberculosis.
B. Low serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an enzyme that is elevated in some autoimmune disorders, such as lupus. However, in this patient's case, the symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with an infectious process, such as tuberculosis.
C. Low serum CD4+ T-cell count - A low CD4+ T-cell count can be a sign of immune system suppression, which can increase the risk of infection. However, in this patient's case, the symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with an infectious process, such as tuberculosis.
D. Positive anti-dsDNA antibody testing - Anti-dsDNA antibodies are commonly found in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disorder. However, in this patient's case, the symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with an infectious process, such as tuberculosis.

Answer: C. Low serum CD4+ T-cell count. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with an infectious process, such as tuberculosis, which can cause immune system suppression and increase the risk of infection. A low CD4+ T-cell count is a common finding in patients with tuberculosis."
999,"Question: A 55-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction 3 months ago presents with feelings of depression. He says that he has become detached from his friends and family and has daily feelings of hopelessness. He says he has started to avoid strenuous activities and is no longer going to his favorite bar where he used to spend a lot of time drinking with his buddies. The patient says these symptoms have been ongoing for the past 6 weeks, and his wife is starting to worry about his behavior. He notes that he continues to have nightmares that he is having another heart attack. He says he is even more jumpy than he used to be, and he startles very easily. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

Options:

A. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): This condition is likely in this patient due to the recent history of myocardial infarction, which can be a traumatic event that can lead to the development of PTSD. The patient's symptoms of avoidance, hypervigilance, and nightmares are also consistent with PTSD.

B. Major depression disorder: Depression is a common complication of myocardial infarction, and the patient's symptoms of hopelessness, detachment, and avoidance of activities are consistent with major depression. However, the patient's history of myocardial infarction and ongoing nightmares about having another heart attack suggest that PTSD may be a more likely diagnosis.

C. Alcohol withdrawal: Alcohol withdrawal can cause anxiety, irritability, and avoidance of social activities, which are similar to the patient's symptoms. However, the patient's history of myocardial infarction and ongoing nightmares about having another heart attack suggest that alcohol withdrawal is less likely.

D. Midlife crisis: A midlife crisis is a common phenomenon that can occur in people in their 50s, characterized by feelings of dissatisfaction with life, anxiety, and a desire for change. However, the patient's symptoms of hopelessness, detachment, and avoidance of activities are more consistent with PTSD or depression."
